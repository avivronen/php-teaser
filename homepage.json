Wit­ness­es in Gaza said that a new, five-story head­quar­ters of the In­te­rior Min­istry was re­duced to rub­ble and that the strikes had al­so hit the homes of Mah­moud al-Za­har, a sen­ior Ha­mas leader; Fathi Ha­mad, the move­ment’s for­mer in­te­rior min­is­ter; Is­mail al-Ashqar, a mem­ber of the de­funct Par­lia­ment; and Bassem Naim, an ad­viser to the for­mer prime min­is­ter of Gaza, Is­mail Haniya.</p> <p>“They are key play­ers in the de­ci­sion-mak­ing of Ha­mas’s ter­ror­ist ma­chine,” Lt. Col. Pe­ter Lern­er, a mil­i­tary spokes­man, said in an in­ter­view.</p> <p>The re­newed as­sault fol­lowed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/world/middleeast/after-brief-lull-in-gaza-crisis-airstrikes-resume.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=HpSum&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">a six-hour pause</a> on Tues­day af­ter Is­rael briefly ac­cept­ed an Egypt­ian pro­posal to halt the hos­til­ities that be­gan Ju­ly 7. Ha­mas and oth­er mil­i­tant groups in Gaza ig­nored or re­ject­ed the cease-fire ini­tia­tive and launched more than 125 rock­ets through­out Is­rael all day and night.</p> <p>The Pal­es­tin­ian death toll reached 201 on Wednes­day, ac­cord­ing to Gaza’s Health Min­istry, af­ter a strike on a car in the south­ern town of Khan You­nis killed three. At least eight peo­ple were killed overnight, among them a 5-year-old girl who fell from a high spot. A fu­neral was set for Wednes­day af­ter­noon for Dror Khenin, 37, the first Is­raeli to die in the nine-day con­flict. A mor­tar shell killed him Tues­day night while he was dis­trib­ut­ing food to sol­diers near a bor­der cross­ing in­to Gaza.</p> <p>“I call for se­cur­ing the safe­ty of the cit­i­zens of Is­rael,” said the Is­raeli for­eign min­is­ter, Avig­dor Lieber­man, Is­raeli ra­dio re­port­ed. “To the best of my un­der­stand­ing, it is not pos­si­ble to en­sure sum­mer va­ca­tion, a nor­mal sum­mer for our kids with­out a ground op­er­a­tion in Gaza”</p> <p>“We don’t need to rule Gaza, or build set­tle­ments in Gaza,” he added. “We need to en­sure that all Ha­mas ter­ror­ists run away, are im­pris­oned or will die.”</p> <p>Short­ly af­ter Mr. Lieber­man made his state­ment, he was forced to seek shel­ter while meet­ing with his Nor­we­gian coun­ter­part, Borge Brende, in the city of Ashkelon, ac­cord­ing to Ynet, an on­line Is­raeli news out­let. Af­ter sirens sound­ed, Ynet re­port­ed, a rock­et ex­ploded near­by.</p> <p>The cur­rent es­ca­la­tion fol­lowed ris­ing ten­sion re­lated to the June 12 ab­duc­tion and killing of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/world/middleeast/Israel-missing-teenagers.html\">three Is­raeli teenagers</a> who were hitch­hik­ing home from their schools in the oc­cu­pied West Bank — Is­rael blamed Ha­mas for their deaths — and the Ju­ly 2 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/world/middleeast/israel.html\">kid­nap­ping and killing of a 16-year-old Pal­es­tin­ian</a> in East Je­ru­sa­lem, which the Is­raeli au­thori­ties say was a re­venge at­tack by ex­trem­ist Jews.</p> <p>Pres­i­dent Mah­moud Ab­bas of the Pal­es­tin­ian Au­thor­ity, whose April rec­on­cil­i­a­tion with Ha­mas helped lead to the col­lapse of Amer­i­can-bro­kered peace talks with Is­rael, was sched­uled to meet on Wednes­day with Pres­i­dent Abdel Fat­tah el-Sisi of Egypt re­gard­ing the pro­posed cease-fire. Mr. Ab­bas planned to travel to Turkey for sim­i­lar talks on Fri­day.</p> <p>It was un­clear how many Gazans were heed­ing the Is­raeli mil­i­tary’s call for evac­u­a­tions; Ha­mas has urged peo­ple to stay put, call­ing the warn­ings “psy­cho­log­i­cal war­fare.” In the densely pop­u­lat­ed and poor neigh­bor­hoods of Zeitoun and She­jaya in Gaza City, many peo­ple ap­peared con­fused, with some seek­ing shel­ter in friends’ homes deep­er in­side the neigh­bor­hoods rather than leav­ing.</p> <p>“We don’t know where we’re go­ing, we’re go­ing aim­less­ly,” said Mo­ham­med Dalul, who was dri­ving a don­key cart with his six chil­dren and an eld­erly neigh­bor. They car­ried on­ly a can­is­ter of cook­ing gas and a sin­gle bag of clothes for the chil­dren. “No­body is look­ing af­ter us,” said the neigh­bor, Naz­i­ha Rukhneh.</p> <p>The streets were emp­ti­er than nor­mal, but a few chil­dren flew kites and some men sat in the shade. Around noon, eight rock­ets were launched si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly from near­by; a few min­utes later, the sound of a war­plane was fol­lowed by that of a bomb drop­ping.</p> <p>Ah­med Sa­lim said that he had ig­nored the gen­er­al evac­u­a­tion warn­ing, though he had heed­ed a per­son­al­ized one three days ago when it was sent to his broth­er’s cell­phone; a strike hit the house 10 min­utes later, said Mr. Sa­lim, who is now stay­ing with a neigh­bor.</p> <p>“All of it, the four stories, are flat­tened,” he said. “All I have is the clothes I am wear­ing.”</p> <p>A Hu­man Rights Watch re­port re­leased on Wednes­day cited Unit­ed Na­tions da­ta show­ing that, as of Mon­day, more than three-quar­ters of the Pales­tini­ans killed were civil­ians, in­clud­ing 36 chil­dren, and that ap­prox­i­mate­ly 7,500 peo­ple had been dis­placed by the de­struc­tion of 1,255 homes. The Hu­man Rights Watch re­port in­ves­ti­gat­ed four Is­raeli strikes – on the Fun Time Beach cafe in the south­ern city of Khan You­nis; on a car car­ry­ing mu­nici­pal work­ers in the Bu­reij ref­u­gee camp; and two on homes where vic­tims in­cluded a preg­nant woman and small chil­dren.</p> <p>“Is­rael’s rhet­o­ric is all about pre­ci­sion at­tacks, but at­tacks with no mil­i­tary tar­get and many ci­vil­ian deaths can hard­ly be con­sid­ered pre­cise,” Sarah Leah Whit­son, the Mid­dle East di­rec­tor of Hu­man Rights Watch, said in the re­port. “Re­cent doc­u­ment­ed cases in Gaza sad­ly fit Is­rael’s long record of un­law­ful airstrikes with high ci­vil­ian ca­su­al­ties.”</p> <p>The re­port al­so crit­i­cized Is­rael’s tac­tic of warn­ing res­i­dents to evac­u­ate, say­ing it “does not make an oth­er­wise un­law­ful at­tack law­ful.”</p> <p>Asked about the re­port, Colo­nel Lern­er said Hu­man Rights Watch was “ig­nor­ing the fact that Ha­mas is deeply em­bed­ded in an un­der­ground Gaza Strip,” re­fer­ring to tun­nels that he said were used to launch rock­ets. He said more than half the tar­gets of the cur­rent op­er­a­tion had been con­cealed rock­et launch­ers.</p> </div>",

Why did the Sat­urn Ion he was trav­el­ing in, along a rur­al Texas road, sud­den­ly swerve in­to a tree? Why did the air bags fail? Gen­er­al Mo­tors told fed­eral au­thori­ties that it could not pro­vide an­swers.</p> <p>But on­ly a month ear­lier, a G.M. en­gi­neer had con­clud­ed in an in­ter­nal eval­u­a­tion that the Ion had most like­ly lost pow­er, dis­abling its air bags, ac­cord­ing to a sub­se­quent in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion com­mis­sioned by G.M.</p> <p>Now, G.M.'s re­sponse, as well as its re­plies to que­ries in oth­er crash­es ob­tained by The New York Times from the Na­tion­al High­way Traf­fic Safe­ty Ad­min­is­tra­tion, casts doubt on how forth­right the au­tomak­er was with reg­u­la­tors over a de­fec­tive ig­ni­tion switch that G.M. has linked to at least 13 deaths over the last dec­ade.</p> <p>They pro­vide de­tails for the first time on the is­sue at the heart of a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the Jus­tice De­part­ment: whether G.M., in its in­ter­ac­tion with safe­ty reg­u­la­tors, ob­scured a dead­ly de­fect that would al­so in­jure per­haps hun­dreds of peo­ple.</p> <p>The com­pa­ny re­peat­ed­ly found a way not to an­swer the sim­ple ques­tion from reg­u­la­tors of what led to a crash. In at least three cases of fa­tal crash­es, in­clud­ing the ac­ci­dent that killed Mr. Er­ick­son, G.M. said that it had not as­sessed the cause. In an­other fa­tal crash, G.M. said that at­tor­ney-cli­ent priv­i­lege may have pre­vent­ed it from an­swer­ing. And in oth­er cases, the au­tomak­er was more blunt, writ­ing, “G.M. opts not to re­spond.” The re­sponses came even though G.M. had for years been aware of sud­den pow­er loss in the mod­els in­volved in the ac­ci­dents.</p> <p>The re­sponses are found in doc­u­ments known as “death in­quir­ies,” which The Times ob­tained through the Free­dom of In­for­ma­tion Act. In those in­quir­ies, reg­u­la­tors ask au­tomak­ers to ex­plain the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing a crash to help iden­ti­fy po­ten­tial de­fects in cars.</p> <p>On Thurs­day, the head of G.M.'s le­gal de­part­ment, Mi­chael P. Mil­likin, is ex­pect­ed to face in­tense scru­tiny be­fore law­mak­ers at a Sen­ate hear­ing. He is sched­uled to tes­ti­fy along with, among oth­ers, Mary T. Bar­ra, the chief ex­ec­u­tive, who faced a harsh grilling be­fore the same panel in April.</p> <p>The Times asked the safe­ty agency for death in­quir­ies re­lated to fa­tal crash­es in older Chevro­let Cobalts and Sat­urn Ions, which are among the 2.6 mil­lion cars with de­fec­tive ig­ni­tion switch­es that G.M. has re­called since Feb­ru­ary. Of the 13 deaths linked to the de­fect, all of which in­volved Cobalts and Ions, The Times re­ceived in­quir­ies for four of them.</p> <p>Mr. Er­ick­son was rid­ing in the front seat of a Sat­urn Ion driven by Can­dice An­der­son in 2004. They were an hour from Dal­las when the car sud­den­ly drove in­to a tree, killing Mr. Er­ick­son but spar­ing Ms. An­der­son. On­ly re­cent­ly did Ms. An­der­son, who plead­ed guilty to crim­i­nal­ly neg­li­gent homi­cide af­ter the ac­ci­dent be­cause she had a trace of Xanax in her sys­tem, learn that she was not to blame.</p> <p>De­spite the ear­lier de­ter­mi­na­tion by the en­gi­neer, Manuel Peace, that the en­gine’s shut­ting off had most like­ly been the rea­son for the crash, G.M., in its re­sponse to reg­u­la­tors, said there may not have been “suf­fi­cient re­li­able in­for­ma­tion to ac­cu­rate­ly as­sess the cause” of the in­ci­dent.</p> <p>G.M., which al­so faced a law­suit from Mr. Er­ick­son’s fam­ily at the time, fur­ther stat­ed that at­tor­ney-cli­ent priv­i­lege may have been a rea­son it could not make dis­clo­sures.</p> <p>Ul­ti­mate­ly, G.M. said it had not as­sessed the cause of the ac­ci­dent.</p> <p>“It seems in­con­sis­tent,” said Carl To­bias, a law pro­fes­sor at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Rich­mond, who spe­cial­izes in prod­uct li­abil­ity. “It seems like the com­pa­ny knew that the ac­ci­dent was at­trib­ut­a­ble to pow­er loss. It does sound like they didn’t give N.H.T.S.A. ev­ery­thing they should have. That could make them vul­ner­a­ble to the Jus­tice De­part­ment’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion.”</p> <p>When asked about G.M.'s re­sponses to the gov­ern­ment’s death in­quir­ies, James Cain, a spokes­man, said on Tues­day: “We are con­fronting our prob­lems open­ly and di­rect­ly. We are tak­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity for what has hap­pened and mak­ing sig­nif­i­cant changes across our com­pa­ny to make sure that it nev­er hap­pens again.”</p> <p>In a later death in­quiry, G.M. chose not to say whether it had looked in­to the cir­cum­stances of the De­cem­ber 2009 crash in Ten­nessee that killed Seyde Chan­suthus, who is al­so count­ed among the 13 vic­tims. G.M. added in its re­sponse that any priv­i­leged ma­terial re­lated to the case would not be shared. The com­pa­ny had not been sued by Ms. Chan­suthus’s fam­ily at the time.</p> <p>But there had al­ready been a thor­ough re­view of Ms. Chan­suthus’s ac­ci­dent with­in G.M.</p> <p>Six days be­fore that let­ter to reg­u­la­tors, lawyers rep­re­sent­ing G.M. had pre­sented an eval­u­a­tion of the crash to the au­tomak­er, ac­cord­ing to the in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­duct­ed by G.M. this year. The lawyers warned that G.M. could be li­a­ble for pu­ni­tive dam­ages be­cause air bags in Cobalts were known not to de­ploy in some cases.</p> <p>In a third fa­tal crash, in­volv­ing the deaths of Amy Rade­mak­er and Natasha Weigel, teenage friends killed in Wis­con­sin in 2006, G.M. again re­spond­ed that it could not pro­vide an an­swer to what caused the ac­ci­dent, us­ing the same lan­guage as in its re­ply to ques­tions about Mr. Er­ick­son’s crash.</p> <p>In this case, G.M. had re­ceived out­side ev­i­dence that there was a prob­lem with the switch, in­clud­ing a state troop­er’s col­li­sion re­port from Feb­ru­ary 2007 that made the crit­i­cal link be­tween the faulty ig­ni­tion switch and the air bags fail­ing to de­ploy. G.M.'s in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion said that on­ly one per­son in­side G.M. had even opened the re­port, though it was in­cluded in the re­ply to reg­u­la­tors, who al­so failed to fol­low through. One of the re­quire­ments on the death in­quiry is to pro­vide a copy of the po­lice re­port.</p> <p>When asked for com­ment, Da­vid Fried­man, the safe­ty agency’s act­ing ad­min­is­tra­tor, said, “G.M.'s de­ci­sion-mak­ing, struc­ture, process and cor­po­rate cul­ture stood in the way of safe­ty.”</p> <p>G.M.'s re­luc­tance to re­spond to the gov­ern­ment with eval­u­a­tions of sus­pi­cious crash­es ex­tend­ed be­yond just the ac­ci­dents that the au­tomak­er has pub­licly linked to its ig­ni­tion de­fect.</p> <p>Sev­eral fa­tal crash­es — in­clud­ing those of Ben­jamin Hair, 20, in Vir­ginia, and Amy Kosil­la, 23, in New York — al­so had death in­quir­ies. In both those cases, when asked to ex­plain why the ve­hi­cles had driven straight off the road — with front im­pacts and no air bag de­ploy­ment — the au­tomak­er took ad­van­tage of the op­tion­al na­ture of the ques­tion and did not re­ply. Death in­quir­ies date back to the late 1990s, when the safe­ty agency was crit­i­cized for fail­ing to spot high­way rollovers in Ford Ex­plor­ers with Fire­stone tires, a prob­lem even­tu­al­ly tied to 271 deaths.</p> <p>In re­sponse, Con­gress passed a law in 2000 re­quir­ing au­tomak­ers to re­port to reg­u­la­tors any claims they re­ceived blam­ing de­fects for in­ju­ries or deaths, so the gov­ern­ment would not have to re­ly on­ly on con­sumer re­ports. The agency al­so has the abil­i­ty to dig deep­er in­to any of those claims by then do­ing a death in­quiry — ask­ing the au­tomak­er for doc­u­men­ta­tion of each car ac­ci­dent and an as­sess­ment of the cir­cum­stances lead­ing to each crash.</p> <p>In the end, both G.M. and those charged with over­see­ing the com­pa­ny fell short in pro­tect­ing the pub­lic, Mr. To­bias, the law pro­fes­sor, said. “It’s dis­cour­ag­ing to see that both the com­pa­ny was not be­ing as straight­for­ward as it might have been,” he said, “and that N.H.T.S.A. was not be­ing as rig­or­ous about these in­quir­ies that it should have been.”</p> </div>",

The <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140716005729/en/Time-Warner-Rejects-Unsolicited-Proposal-Twenty-First-Century#.U8Z4V_ldV8E\">Time Warn­er state­ment</a> point­ed to its own stra­tegic plan, what it said was “un­cer­tain­ty” over the value of 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox stock and reg­u­la­tory risks as among the rea­sons for its re­buff.</p><p>The com­pa­ny said that 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox had of­fered 1.531 of its Class A non-vot­ing com­mon shares and $32.42 in cash for ev­ery Time Warn­er share — or a to­tal of near­ly $86.30, a pre­mium of rough­ly 22 per­cent to Time Warn­er’s clos­ing price on Tues­day.</p><p>Ear­lier on Wednes­day, 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox al­so con­firmed that it had made a for­mal of­fer to Time Warn­er last month. ”The Time Warn­er board of di­rec­tors de­clined to pur­sue our pro­posal,” the state­ment said. “We are not cur­rent­ly in any dis­cus­sions with Time Warn­er.”</p><p>To­gether, 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox and Time Warn­er would be­come a co­los­sus with an ar­ray of tele­vi­sion net­works and chan­nels like Fox, Fox News, FX, TNT and TBS; the pre­mium sub­scrip­tion chan­nel <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/home_box_office_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">HBO</a>, movie stu­dios like 20th Cen­tu­ry Fox, <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/warner_bros_entertainment_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Warn­er Bros.</a> and oth­er prom­i­nent out­lets. It would al­so com­bine Fox’s grow­ing sports busi­ness with the broad­cast rights that Time Warn­er owns for pro­fes­sion­al and col­lege bas­ket­ball and Ma­jor League Base­ball, among oth­er sports.</p><p>The com­bined com­pa­ny would have to­tal rev­e­nue of $65 bil­lion.</p><p>Shares of Time Warn­er were up about 20 per­cent in pre­mar­ket trad­ing on Wednes­day morn­ing.</p><p>As part of the pro­posal to buy Time Warn­er, peo­ple briefed on the pro­posal said, 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox in­di­cat­ed that it would sell CNN to head off po­ten­tial an­titrust con­cerns since Fox News com­petes di­rect­ly with CNN. Putting CNN on the auc­tion block would like­ly stir up a bid­ding war for the news chan­nel; both <a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=CBS&amp;inline=nyt-org\">CBS</a> and ABC, a unit of the <a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=DIS&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Walt Dis­ney Com­pa­ny</a>, have long been viewed as in­ter­est­ed suit­ors.</p><p>The com­pa­ny first ap­proached Time Warn­er in ear­ly June, these peo­ple said. Chase Carey, the pres­i­dent of 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox and a long­time top lieu­ten­ant to Mr. Mur­doch, met pri­vate­ly with Time Warn­er’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, Jeff Be­wkes, these peo­ple said. 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox said it would raise $24 bil­lion to help pay for the deal and stressed that its bid was not de­pend­ent on fi­nanc­ing.</p><p>The com­pa­ny es­ti­mated that a com­bi­na­tion would cre­ate $1 bil­lion in cost sav­ings and pos­si­bly more, pri­mar­ily by cut­ting sales staff and back-of­fice func­tions, these peo­ple said. In its let­ter, 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox in­sist­ed that it planned to keep Time Warn­er’s most suc­cess­ful man­ag­ers and cre­ative ex­ec­u­tives as well as its var­i­ous chan­nels and stu­dios.</p><p>Time Warn­er’s board dis­cussed the pro­posal at length, the peo­ple briefed said, and ear­ly this month it sent a terse let­ter re­ject­ing the of­fer, say­ing the com­pa­ny was bet­ter off re­main­ing in­de­pend­ent.</p><p>Among the points of con­tention: The stock por­tion of 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox’s of­fer would be made us­ing non­vot­ing shares, these peo­ple said. Un­like Time Warn­er, which has no con­trol­ling share­holder, 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox is con­trolled by the Mur­doch fam­ily and has two tiers of stock, vot­ing and non­vot­ing.</p><p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives for 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox and Time Warn­er could not be im­me­di­ate­ly reached for com­ment.</p><p>It is un­clear what 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox’s next steps will be. With the dis­clo­sure of the take­over ap­proach, pres­sure from Time Warn­er share­hold­ers could mount on Mr. Be­wkes to be­gin talks. About 70 per­cent of Time Warn­er share­hold­ers, in­clud­ing many big mu­tual funds, al­so own shares in 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox.</p><p>While the talks be­tween the two com­pa­nies have thus far been con­sid­ered friend­ly, peo­ple in­volved in the dis­cus­sions said that Mr. Mur­doch is de­ter­mined to buy Time Warn­er and is un­like­ly to walk away.</p><p>Mr. Mur­doch has been plan­ning the deal with his in­ner cir­cle: Mr. Carey; his son James; and the com­pa­ny’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer, John Nallen, peo­ple briefed on the mat­ter said.</p><p>Al­ready, a team of Wall Street ad­vis­ers have been hired on both sides: 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox is be­ing ad­vised by <a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GS&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Gold­man Sachs</a> and Cen­ter­view Part­ners, while Time Warn­er has hired <a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=C&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Cit­i­group</a> and oth­er ad­vis­ers.</p><p>For Mr. Mur­doch, an ac­qui­si­tion of Time Warn­er might be a cap­stone to his long ca­reer. Peo­ple close to him have said that he sees such a com­bi­na­tion as a nat­u­ral part of a con­soli­dat­ing en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try. Time Warn­er it­self has been part of sev­eral of the biggest merg­ers of the past few decades, in­clud­ing the merg­er of <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/time_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Time</a> and Warn­er in the 1980s and the dis­as­trous $165 bil­lion sale to Amer­ica On­line at the height of the dot-com boom.</p><p>Mr. Mur­doch’s ap­proach comes af­ter Time Warn­er’s spin­off of its leg­acy print pub­li­ca­tions, a move that some an­a­lysts have said could spur the in­ter­est of po­ten­tial bid­ders. Be­yond 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox, how­ever, it is not clear who would have both the in­ter­est and the fi­nan­cial fire­pow­er to pur­sue a deal, though ru­mors briefly arose that <a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GOOGL&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Google</a> was in­ter­est­ed in some sort of part­ner­ship.</p><p>Mr. Be­wkes was asked <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/biz/news/google-fox-time-warner-1201260050/\">last week by Va­ri­ety mag­a­zine</a> about spec­u­la­tion that 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox or <a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GOOGL&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Google</a> might seek a deal. He re­plied: “I know noth­ing about it.”</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>WASH­ING­TON — Short­ly af­ter the video be­gins, a man in his 20s dressed in cam­ou­flage ap­pears on screen and be­gins a re­cruit­ment speech.</p> <p>His pitch is fair­ly straight­for­ward: Come join the fight — you don’t need to be a rad­i­cal to be a ji­ha­di.</p> <p>He says he was just a nor­mal teen­ager grow­ing up in Can­ada, fish­ing and watch­ing hock­ey, be­fore he left it all for the bat­tle­fields of Syria.</p> <p>“It’s not like I was some so­cial out­cast, wasn’t like I was some an­ar­chist or some­body who just wants to de­stroy the world and kill ev­ery­body,” he said. “No, I was a reg­u­lar per­son. And, mu­ja­hedeen are reg­u­lar peo­ple, too.”</p> <p>But while the young man in the video, An­dre Poulin, cast him­self as just a typi­cal Ca­na­dian, the au­thori­ties there say he lived a far dif­fer­ent life from the one he de­scribed. In his late teens and ear­ly 20s, ac­cord­ing to a Ca­na­dian pros­ecu­tor, Mr. Poulin learned how to build ex­plo­sives on­line and con­sid­ered be­com­ing an an­ar­chist or a Com­mu­nist, be­fore con­vert­ing to Is­lam. </p> <p>And the video goes on to show where his be­liefs ul­ti­mate­ly led.</p> <p>Af­ter Mr. Poulin — later known as Abu Mus­lim — fin­ish­es his mono­logue, he is seen run­ning through a field in Syria dur­ing a siege of an air­port, then dy­ing in the bat­tle. A graph­ic pic­ture of his corpse is shown, and he is hailed as a mar­tyr. He was like­ly 24 at the time of his death last year.</p> <p>The video is be­lieved to be one of the first pieces of me­dia in which the Is­lam­ic State in Iraq and Syria — or ISIS, the group that con­trols large parts of both coun­tries — used an Eng­lish-speak­ing North Amer­i­can to try to lure oth­ers to fight on its side. It was dis­trib­uted re­cent­ly by a prop­a­ganda arm of ISIS, known for hav­ing one of the slick­est and most ag­gres­sive me­dia op­er­a­tions in the Is­lam­ic world, ac­cord­ing to ex­perts who track ji­had­ist ma­te­ri­als. </p> <p>As its fight­ers have gained more ter­ri­to­ry in Iraq and Syria, ISIS has taken over World Cup hash­tags on Twit­ter to spread prop­a­ganda screeds and used Face­book to gen­er­ate death threats.</p> <p>“Once ISIS ex­pand­ed in­to Syria, it was forced to com­pete with a lot of ji­ha­di groups, and it took the pro­duc­tion of its me­dia to a high­er level than any oth­er ji­ha­di group had pre­vi­ous­ly cre­ated,” said Laith Alkhouri, a sen­ior an­a­lyst at Flash­point Glob­al Part­ners, a New York se­cu­rity con­sult­ing firm that tracks mil­i­tant web­sites. “It lit­er­ally rev­o­lu­tion­ized how it pro­duced, dis­trib­uted and trans­lated its mes­sage very quick­ly. The pro­duc­tion value is very high.”</p> <p>Law en­force­ment of­fi­cials in Eu­rope, Can­ada and the Unit­ed States have un­cov­ered ev­i­dence that many of the for­eign­ers who have trav­eled to Syria to fight have been in­spired by on­line me­dia they have seen from ji­hadis. Through chat rooms, email and text mes­sages, the groups arrange for them to travel to Syria to be­gin mil­i­tant train­ing.</p> <p>The re­cruit­ment video fea­tur­ing Mr. Poulin is called “The Cho­sen Few of Dif­fer­ent Lands” and starts with pic­tur­esque footage of the Ca­na­dian coun­try­side as he de­scribes his child­hood.</p> <p>“Be­fore I come here to Syria, I had mon­ey, I had fam­ily, I had good friends, I had col­leagues,” Mr. Poulin said. “You know I worked as a street jan­i­tor — I made over $2,000 a month at this job. It was a very good job, a very good job.”</p> <p>He added: “And even though I wasn’t rich be­yond my wild­est imag­i­na­tions, you know I was mak­ing it. It was good, and you know I al­ways had fam­ily to sup­port me, and I had friends to sup­port me.”</p> <p>But life in Can­ada was not re­li­gious­ly ful­fill­ing, Mr. Poulin said, and he asks his fel­low Mus­lim “broth­ers” on the video how they can please God when they are liv­ing in coun­tries where their tax­es are be­ing used “to as­sist the war on Is­lam.”</p> <p>Ap­peal­ing for help, he said that the ji­had in Syria need­ed en­gi­neers, doc­tors, fund-rais­ers and oth­ers. “If you can­not fight, then you can give mon­ey,” he said. “And if you can­not give mon­ey, then you can as­sist in tech­nol­ogy. And if you can’t as­sist in tech­nol­ogy, you can use some oth­er skills.”</p> <p>He said that those who came to the ex­pan­sive ter­ri­to­ry his group con­trols in Syria “will be very well taken care of here — your fam­ilies will live here in safe­ty just like back home.”</p> <p>The video then shows Mr. Poulin on the bat­tle­field. A nar­ra­tor de­scribes how Mr. Poulin was jailed in Can­ada, but did not let that stop him as he was “pa­tient and firm.” He then rushed to Syria, mar­ried and had a child but took to the bat­tle­field any­way.</p> <p>Ac­cord­ing to the pros­ecu­tor in Tim­mins, On­tario, Mr. Poulin’s home­town, Mr. Poulin was ar­rest­ed twice be­fore con­vert­ing to Is­lam in 2008. The pros­ecu­tor, Ger­rit Ver­beek, said that in 2009, Mr. Poulin moved in with a Mus­lim cou­ple in Tim­mins who had a child. Short­ly af­ter­ward, Mr. Poulin be­gan hav­ing an af­fair with the wife and threat­en­ing the hus­band be­cause he was not re­li­gious enough, Mr. Ver­beek said.</p> <p>At least twice in 2009, Mr. Poulin was ar­rest­ed on charges of mak­ing vi­o­lent threats against the hus­band. On one oc­ca­sion, Mr. Poulin had a box cut­ter and an­other weapon on him, the pros­ecu­tor said. </p> <p>Af­ter one of the ar­rests, Mr. Poulin ad­mit­ted to mak­ing the threats and al­so de­scribed oth­er ac­tiv­i­ties to the po­lice. </p> <p>“He talked about mak­ing bombs — he ad­mit­ted he looked on the In­ter­net at ‘The An­ar­chist Cook­book’ about how to build bombs with ma­te­ri­als you buy at the gro­cery store,” Mr. Ver­beek said. “He said he doesn’t care if he went to jail. Then he says that no­body is go­ing to help him and that ev­ery­body is out to get him. He said some­thing had to be done and he talked about sac­ri­fic­ing him­self.”</p> <p>Mr. Poulin was ar­rest­ed again in 2010 and served two weeks in jail.</p> <p>“And then I nev­er heard from him again,” Mr. Ver­beek said. “He just fell right off the ra­dar. And ap­par­ent­ly, it didn’t turn out so well for Mr. Poulin.”</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>Gov. Chris Christie of New Jer­sey will make his most sig­nif­i­cant and elab­o­rate re­turn to the pres­i­den­tial are­na this week amid in­di­ca­tions that, de­spite his tribu­la­tions, his po­lit­i­cal stand­ing has sta­bi­lized and his ad­vis­ers see a pos­si­ble path to the Re­pub­li­can nom­i­na­tion in 2016.</p> <p>Mr. Christie’s three-city swing through Iowa, the first state to have a say on the pres­i­den­tial race, will rep­re­sent a high­ly pub­lic re­sump­tion of his White House am­bi­tions af­ter six months of scan­dal. It was de­lib­er­ate­ly con­struct­ed to show­case what his ad­vis­ers be­lieve dis­tin­guish­es him from the emerg­ing Re­pub­li­can field: his per­son­al­i­ty and abil­i­ty to in­ter­act spon­ta­neous­ly with or­di­nary peo­ple. </p> <p>The Iowa trip — and a sec­ond planned for New Hamp­shire on Ju­ly 31 — hint at what his back­ers said was a larg­er, del­i­cate, post-lane-clos­ing strat­e­gy for sell­ing a po­ten­tial Christie can­di­da­cy to wary donors and a broad­er Re­pub­li­can base. The strat­e­gy aims to demon­strate that what­ev­er the Tea Par­ty and ide­o­log­i­cal ap­peal of his would-be ri­vals, they lack his gift for, and en­joy­ment of, street-lev­el “re­tail pol­i­tics.” </p> <p>There are plen­ty of rea­sons for skep­ti­cism of the Christie strat­e­gy: Three in­ves­ti­ga­tions are still churn­ing, with no end in sight, and the sheer vol­ume of em­bar­rass­ing rev­e­la­tions about the Christie ad­min­is­tra­tion’s con­duct and cul­ture could ul­ti­mate­ly doom his pres­i­den­tial chances. </p> <p>The gov­er­nor’s ri­vals are al­ready rais­ing point­ed ques­tions about his lead­er­ship, in­clud­ing his fi­nan­cial man­age­ment in New Jer­sey. And it is not clear that per­son­al­i­ty and charis­ma still mat­ter in a par­ty that has be­come so de­fined by con­ser­v­a­tive ide­ol­o­gy.</p> <p>But re­cent polling and dis­cus­sions with Re­pub­li­can of­fi­cials around the coun­try have left Mr. Christie’s sup­port­ers and ad­vis­ers more per­suad­ed that, de­spite the dam­age from his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s role in touch­ing off days of hor­ren­dous traf­fic on the George Wash­ing­ton Bridge last fall, there is a place for Mr. Christie in the pres­i­den­tial con­test, should he opt to run, and they are ea­ger for him to be­gin inch­ing for­ward.</p> <p>Even in New Jer­sey, where the lat­est sub­poe­nas and tes­ti­monies from in­ves­ti­ga­tions in­to Mr. Christie’s of­fice are mon­i­tored close­ly, his job ap­proval rat­ing re­mains 50 per­cent and con­sid­er­ably more vot­ers — 45 per­cent against 38 per­cent — view him fa­vor­ably than un­fa­vor­ably, polling shows.</p> <p>And well be­yond New Jer­sey, in­ter­views and pub­lic opin­ion sur­veys show, pri­ma­ry vot­ers re­main open to and in­trigued by the idea of a Christie cam­paign. Ac­cord­ing to a Quin­nip­i­ac Uni­ver­si­ty poll of Iowa vot­ers con­duct­ed at the end of June, 54 per­cent of Iowa Re­pub­li­cans still have a fa­vor­able opin­ion of Mr. Christie, com­pared with 23 per­cent who view him un­fa­vor­ably. His num­bers are less promis­ing among in­de­pen­dents.</p> <p>The gov­er­nor’s aides stress that Mr. Christie will not make his de­ci­sion about whether to pur­sue a can­di­da­cy un­til the end of this year, and em­pha­sized that his trav­el was fo­cused on win­ning gov­er­nor’s races. But in Iowa, where Mr. Christie will ar­rive on Thurs­day morn­ing for a day of cam­paign­ing and fund-rais­ing on be­half of the state’s pop­u­lar Re­pub­li­can gov­er­nor, Ter­ry E. Branstad, he is be­ing viewed as a like­ly can­di­date.</p> <p>“Peo­ple want to give him a chance here,” said Lo­ras Schulte, a mem­ber of the Re­pub­li­can State Cen­tral Com­mit­tee.</p> <p>In two dozen in­ter­views, Re­pub­li­cans in Iowa echoed some of the themes Mr. Christie is ea­ger to stress — that he is a blunt and charis­mat­ic teller of un­pop­u­lar truths. Most strik­ing­ly, few of them have paid much at­ten­tion to the sim­mer­ing con­tro­ver­sy over the lane clos­ings, or con­sid­er the episode to be a ma­jor li­a­bil­i­ty for Mr. Christie. Many of them de­scribed it, dis­mis­sive­ly, as an un­healthy ob­ses­sion of East Coast De­moc­rats.</p> <p>“It’s one of those deals where the me­dia made such a big deal about it that it went un­der the rug,” said Nor­man F. Flea­gle, a 70-year-old farmer in In­di­anola, Iowa, who praised Mr. Christie for “hav­ing the gump­tion to do what­ev­er he thinks is right, no mat­ter how pop­u­lar it is.”</p> <p>“I think it’s a good trait,” he added.</p> <p>Mr. Branstad, Iowa’s five-term gov­er­nor, said that view of the George Wash­ing­ton Bridge sto­ry was wide­ly held. “Re­al­ly, most peo­ple here have nev­er heard of it and don’t care much about it,” Mr. Branstad said. Those who did, he said, “have moved on.”</p> <p>Mr. Christie, he said, “could very much be a con­tender here.”</p> <p>Still, de­spite those signs of open­ness, Pe­ter A. Brown, as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of the Quin­nip­i­ac poll, cau­tioned against too much op­ti­mism among Christie sup­port­ers, in part be­cause the gov­er­nor’s com­peti­tors will make the bridge scan­dal part of a broad­er at­tack on him. </p> <p>“The prob­lem with Bridge­gate is not traf­fic in a place like Iowa,” Mr. Brown said. “It’s the charge by Christie’s op­po­nents, in ei­ther par­ty, that what hap­pened is symp­to­matic of how he runs his ad­min­is­tra­tion.”</p> <p>And the sur­vey shows that in­de­pen­dent vot­ers, once an elec­toral bul­wark for Mr. Christie in places like Iowa, are now far less en­am­ored. In an open cau­cus sys­tem in which they can par­tic­i­pate, 34 per­cent of in­de­pen­dents in Iowa view him un­fa­vor­ably, com­pared with 30 per­cent who hold a fa­vor­able view, Quin­nip­i­ac’s poll found. “He has to im­prove there,” Mr. Brown said.</p> <p>Dur­ing his Iowa vis­it on Thurs­day, Mr. Christie will speak at three fund-rais­ers: an event for the Re­pub­li­can Gov­er­nors As­so­ci­a­tion, the group he heads, at a pri­vate home out­side Des Moines; a lun­cheon for Speak­er Kraig Paulsen of the Iowa House in Cedar Rapids; and in the day’s mar­quee ses­sion, an out­door cook­out for Mr. Branstad at the fair­grounds in Dav­en­port, which is open to the pub­lic for a low tick­et price. (In­vi­ta­tions bill it as “An Evening at the Fair with Chris Christie.” On the menu: whiskey-mar­i­nat­ed pork loin and sweet corn with ba­con and cheese curds.)</p> <p>Aides said they planned for Mr. Christie to make a stop near Cedar Rapids to min­gle with Iowa vot­ers, who are famed (and en­vied) for their up-close, town-by-town vet­ting of pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates. </p> <p>Such pub­lic ap­pear­ances in his trav­els as head of the Re­pub­li­can Gov­er­nors As­so­ci­a­tion were all but ban­ished af­ter the bridge con­tro­ver­sy erupt­ed, when he faced calls to step down as chair­man of the group and his events were strict­ly off lim­its to the pub­lic and news me­dia.</p> <p>He plans to trav­el to New Hamp­shire on Ju­ly 31 to at­tend a mi­nor-league base­ball game with Sen­a­tor Kel­ly Ay­otte and hold an­oth­er pub­lic event. A WMUR Gran­ite State poll re­leased last week showed Mr. Christie in the top tier in the field of Re­pub­li­can con­tenders.</p> <p>Mr. Christie’s back­ers are in­creas­ing­ly fo­cused on his per­son­al­i­ty as an as­set, in part be­cause of the ob­vi­ous con­trast with Pres­i­dent Oba­ma, and their be­lief that, af­ter eight years of a phleg­mat­ic and some­times dis­tant fig­ure in the White House, the pub­lic will re­spond to a more emo­tive, pas­sion­ate and ex­pan­sive leader — a role they do not see filled by the pre­sump­tive De­mo­c­ra­t­ic front-run­ner, Hillary Rod­ham Clin­ton.</p> <p>Fur­ther­more, the emerg­ing Tea Par­ty-backed White House as­pi­rants, es­pe­cial­ly Sen­a­tors Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, are more an­i­mat­ed by ideas and ap­pear more com­fort­able speak­ing un­in­ter­rupt­ed at a pol­i­cy sem­i­nar or the Sen­ate floor than in one-on-one un­script­ed in­ter­ac­tions with vot­ers. And the field still re­mains un­set­tled and bereft of a front-run­ner, es­pe­cial­ly giv­en the re­luc­tance of the for­mer Flori­da gov­er­nor Jeb Bush to com­mit to a cam­paign.</p> <p>The ques­tion, for Mr. Christie, is how far per­son­al­i­ty can pro­pel him in a drawn-out, bru­tal cam­paign, es­pe­cial­ly when con­ser­v­a­tives re­main sus­pi­cious of his ide­ol­o­gy.</p> <p>Den­nis L. Hal­sne, a 67-year-old from Wood­ward, Iowa, con­sid­ers Mr. Christie the an­ti­dote to a cur­rent pres­i­dent whom he views as in­de­ci­sive and in­ef­fec­tive: “I hate some­body who is wishy-washy, and what I know about Christie, he’s not that way at all. He will some­times stick his foot in his mouth. But he tries to tell like it is.” He added, “I re­al­ly like that about him.”</p> <p>Dorothy A. Hat­field, a re­tired nurse in Ames, Iowa, said Mr. Christie “seems so straight­for­ward.” </p> <p>“I mean, you do get tired of dou­ble­s­peak from politi­cians,” she con­tin­ued. “I haven’t heard that from Chris Christie.”</p> <p>The gov­er­nor of New Jer­sey, she said, fit her im­age of a firm and de­ci­sive pres­i­dent. “I think we need a strong leader. He has that per­son­al­i­ty,” she said. “Some peo­ple might find him over­pow­er­ing. I don’t.”</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>For cen­turies peo­ple have found mean­ing — or thought they did — in what they could see in the sky, the shapes of the con­stel­la­tions echo­ing old myths, the sud­den feath­ery in­tru­sion of comets, the reg­u­lar dances of the plan­ets, the chains of galax­ies, span­ning un­fath­omable dis­tances of time and space.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, how­ev­er, as­tronomers have been forced to con­front the pos­si­bil­i­ty that most of the uni­verse is in­vis­i­ble, and that all the glit­ter­ing chains of galax­ies are no more sub­stan­tial, no more re­li­able guides to phys­i­cal re­al­i­ty, than grease­paint on the face of a clown.</p> <p>The brute math­e­mat­i­cal truth is that atoms, the stuff of stars, you and me, make up on­ly 5 per­cent of the uni­verse by weight. A quar­ter of it is made of mys­te­ri­ous par­ti­cles known as dark mat­ter, and the re­main­ing 70 per­cent a mys­te­ri­ous form of en­er­gy called dark en­er­gy. Physi­cists the­o­rize that dark mat­ter could be ex­ot­ic par­ti­cles left over from the Big Bang. They don’t know what it is, but they can de­duce that dark mat­ter is there by its grav­i­ta­tion­al ef­fect on the things they can see. If New­ton’s laws of grav­i­ty held over cos­mic dis­tances, huge amounts of more mat­ter than we can see were need­ed to pro­vide the grav­i­ta­tion­al glue to keep clus­ters of galax­ies from fly­ing apart, and to keep the stars swirling around in galax­ies at high speed.</p> <p>Cos­mol­o­gists have the­o­rized that it is in fact dark mat­ter, slow­ly con­geal­ing un­der its own weight in­to vast clouds, that pro­vides the scaf­fold­ing for stars and galax­ies.</p> <p>To strip the grease­paint from cos­mic his­to­ry, as­tronomers have per­formed com­put­er sim­u­la­tions of how dark mat­ter would evolve from a near­ly uni­form cloud in­to the fil­a­ments and clumps char­ac­ter­is­tic of the arrange­ment of galax­ies to­day in the lu­mi­nous uni­verse. A multi­na­tion­al group led by Mark Vo­gels­berg­er of the Mass­a­chu­setts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­o­gy has re­cent­ly per­formed one of the most de­tailed of these stud­ies yet, a cal­cu­la­tion called <a href=\"http://www.illustris-project.org/\">Il­lus­tris</a>.</p> <p>Their mod­el sought to take in­to ac­count not just the grav­i­ty of dark mat­ter par­ti­cles pulling atoms and one an­oth­er around, but the elec­tro­mag­net­ic and nu­clear in­ter­ac­tions be­tween atoms — so-called gas­tro­physics — like the for­ma­tion and ex­plo­sion of stars.</p> <p>The re­sult, they said, is the clos­est match yet be­tween dark mat­ter mod­els and the dis­tri­b­u­tion and types of galax­ies in the vis­i­ble uni­verse.</p> <p>Mean­while, as­tronomers at the Cal­i­for­nia In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­o­gy have be­gun to be able to il­lu­mi­nate and map the web­like struc­ture of the dark mat­ter in space us­ing an in­stru­ment they call the Cos­mic Web Im­ager on the 200-inch tele­scope at Palo­mar Ob­ser­va­to­ry. The im­ager in ef­fect us­es bright galax­ies and quasars as a kind of flash­light to light up the sparse atoms strewn along with the dark mat­ter in space, con­firm­ing the ten­dril struc­ture pre­dict­ed by the com­put­er sim­u­la­tions.</p> <p>More ev­i­dence of the pow­er of the dark side.</p> </div>",

Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comp­trol­ler, is press­ing the City Coun­cil to take up such leg­is­la­tion. And last month, Pres­i­dent Oba­ma or­dered fed­er­al agen­cies to give the “right to re­quest” to two mil­lion fed­er­al work­ers.</p> <p>The new laws and pro­pos­als gen­er­al­ly re­quire an em­ploy­er to dis­cuss a new em­ploy­ee’s sit­u­a­tion and to con­sid­er sched­ul­ing re­quests, but they do not re­quire com­pa­nies to ac­com­mo­date in­di­vid­ual sched­ules. Many busi­ness­es have op­posed these mea­sures, ar­gu­ing that they rep­re­sent im­prop­er gov­ern­ment in­tru­sion in­to pri­vate op­er­a­tions.</p> <p>In a ref­er­en­dum last year, vot­ers in SeaT­ac, Wash. — the com­mu­ni­ty near Seat­tle that al­so passed the na­tion’s high­est min­i­mum wage, $15 an hour for some work­ers — ap­proved a mea­sure that bars em­ploy­ers from hir­ing ad­di­tion­al part-time work­ers if any of their ex­ist­ing part-timers want more hours. The move was a re­sponse to com­plaints from work­ers that they were not sched­uled for enough hours to sup­port their fam­i­lies. Some San Fran­cis­co law­mak­ers are seek­ing to en­act a sim­i­lar reg­u­la­tion.</p> <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive George Miller of Cal­i­for­nia, the se­nior De­mo­c­rat on the House Com­mit­tee on Ed­u­ca­tion and the Work­force, plans to in­tro­duce leg­is­la­tion this sum­mer that would re­quire com­pa­nies to pay their em­ploy­ees for an ex­tra hour if they were sum­moned to work with less than 24 hours’ no­tice. He is al­so propos­ing a guar­an­tee of four hours’ pay on days when em­ploy­ees are sent home af­ter just a few hours — some­thing that hap­pens in many restau­rants and re­tail­ers when cus­tomer traf­fic is slow.</p> <p>That hap­pened to Mary Cole­man. Af­ter an hour­long bus com­mute, she ar­rived at her job at a Popeyes in Mil­wau­kee on­ly to have her boss or­der her to go home with­out clock­ing in — even though she was sched­uled to work. She was not paid for the day.</p> <p>“It’s be­com­ing more and more com­mon to put em­ploy­ees in a very un­cer­tain and ten­u­ous po­si­tion with re­spect to their sched­ules, and that ric­o­chets if work­ers have fam­i­lies or oth­er com­mit­ments,” Mr. Miller said. “The em­ploy­er com­mu­ni­ty al­ways says it ab­hors un­cer­tain­ty and un­pre­dictabil­i­ty, but they are cre­at­ing an em­ploy­ment sit­u­a­tion that has huge un­cer­tain­ty and un­pre­dictabil­i­ty for mil­lions of Amer­i­cans.”</p> <p>While Mr. Miller ac­knowl­edges that his bill is un­like­ly to be en­act­ed any­time soon — part­ly be­cause of op­po­si­tion from busi­ness (and a Re­pub­li­can-con­trolled House), he said the bill would bring at­ten­tion to what he called of­ten cal­lous sched­ul­ing prac­tices. His bill, sim­i­lar to one in the Sen­ate spon­sored by Bob Casey, De­mo­c­rat of Penn­syl­va­nia, has a “right to re­quest” pro­vi­sion that would bar em­ploy­ers from deny­ing re­quests from work­ers with care­giv­ing or school-re­lat­ed con­flicts un­less they had a “bona fide” busi­ness rea­son.</p> <p>Cor­po­rate groups protest that such mea­sures un­der­cut ef­fi­cien­cy and prof­its. “The hy­per-reg­u­la­tion of the work­place by gov­ern­ment isn’t con­ducive to a pos­i­tive busi­ness cli­mate,” said Scott De­Fife, an ex­ec­u­tive vice pres­i­dent of the Na­tion­al Restau­rant As­so­ci­a­tion. “The more com­pli­ca­tions that gov­ern­ment cre­ates for op­er­at­ing a busi­ness, the less like­ly we’ll see a pos­i­tive busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment that’s good for the econ­o­my and in­creas­ing jobs.”</p> <p>Mr. De­Fife point­ed out that the dai­ly ebb and flow of cus­tomers ne­ces­si­tat­ed flex­i­bil­i­ty in sched­ul­ing.</p> <p>David French, a se­nior vice pres­i­dent of the Na­tion­al Re­tail Fed­er­a­tion, said many peo­ple chose ca­reers in re­tail be­cause of the flex­i­ble work hours.</p> <p>“These pro­pos­als may sound rea­son­able, but if you un­pack them, they could be very harm­ful,” Mr. French said. “Where em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees now work to­geth­er to solve sched­ul­ing prob­lems, you’ll have a very bu­reau­crat­ic en­vi­ron­ment where rigid rules would be in­tro­duced.”</p> <p>While many of these work­ers are not union­ized, the la­bor move­ment has of­ten bat­tled against part-time work and ever-chang­ing sched­ules. But as unions have grown weak­er, em­ploy­ers have felt freer to em­ploy part-timers and use more volatile sched­ul­ing. Unions still push for work­ers to get more hours — and those pres­sures are one rea­son Ma­cy’s and Wal­mart have adopt­ed pro­grams let­ting em­ploy­ees claim ad­di­tion­al, avail­able shifts by go­ing on­to their em­ploy­ers’ web­sites.</p> <p>In a cli­mate where many re­tail­ers, restau­rants and oth­er busi­ness­es are still strug­gling af­ter the re­ces­sion, econ­o­mists point to the in­creased un­cer­tain­ty faced by em­ploy­ees. About 27.4 mil­lion Amer­i­cans work part time. The num­ber of those part-timers who would pre­fer to work full time has near­ly dou­bled since 2007, to 7.5 mil­lion. Ac­cord­ing to Bu­reau of La­bor Sta­tis­tics da­ta, 47 per­cent of part-time hourly work­ers ages 26 to 32 re­ceive a week or less of ad­vance no­tice for their sched­ule.</p> <p>In a study of the da­ta, two Uni­ver­si­ty of Chica­go pro­fes­sors found that em­ploy­ers dic­tat­ed the work sched­ules for about half of young adults, with­out their in­put. For part-time work­ers, sched­ules on av­er­age fluc­tu­at­ed from 17 to 28 hours a week.</p> <p>“Front­line man­agers face pres­sure to keep costs down, but they re­al­ly don’t have much con­trol over wages or ben­e­fits,” said Su­san J.

I couldn’t make plans,” said Ms. Muham­mad, who said she was now as­signed 25 hours a week.</p> <p>A na­tion­al cam­paign — the Fair Work­week Ini­tia­tive — is push­ing for leg­is­la­tion to re­strict these prac­tices in places in­clud­ing Mil­wau­kee, New York and San­ta Clara, Calif. The ef­fort in­cludes the Na­tion­al Women’s Law Cen­ter, the Unit­ed Food and Com­mer­cial Work­ers union and the Re­tail Ac­tion Project, a New York work­ers’ group.</p> <p>“Too many work­ers are work­ing ei­ther too many or too few hours in an econ­o­my that ex­pects us to be avail­able 24/7,” said Car­rie Glea­son, di­rec­tor of the Fair Work­week Ini­tia­tive and an or­ga­niz­er at the <a title=\"The group's site on an initiative.\" href=\"http://populardemocracy.org/campaign/restoring-fair-workweek\">Cen­ter for Pop­u­lar Democ­ra­cy</a>, a na­tion­al ad­vo­ca­cy group. “It’s got­ten to the point where work­ers, es­pe­cial­ly women work­ers, are say­ing, ‘We need a voice in how much and when we work.' ”</p> </div>",

The be­lief that busi­ness must serve mul­ti­ple con­stituents, he ar­gued, has given way to an im­per­a­tive “to make the share­holder king.”</p> <p>Mil­ton Fried­man, the eco­nom­ic thinker from the Uni­ver­si­ty of Chi­cago, ar­gued that this was ex­act­ly as it should be. The so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity of busi­ness is to in­crease its prof­its, he stat­ed <a title=\"Friedman’s essay.\" href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E05E0DA153CE531A15750C1A96F9C946190D6CF\">in an es­say pub­lished in The New York Times 44 years ago</a>. For ex­ec­u­tives to de­vote re­sources to any­thing else would amount to do­ing char­ity with oth­er peo­ple’s mon­ey.</p> <p>Fried­man’s max­im ar­rived just in time for the era of the hos­tile take­over and the lever­aged buy­out, when cor­po­rate raiders sold them­selves as sav­iors lib­er­at­ing share­hold­ers from mis­guid­ed man­ag­ers who paid too lit­tle at­ten­tion to the stock price.</p> <p>Though le­gally du­bi­ous, the ar­gu­ment that it is an ex­ec­u­tive’s fi­du­ciary du­ty to max­i­mize the com­pa­ny’s share price be­came a mantra from the busi­ness school to the board­room. And it was nailed down with mon­ey.</p> <p>In 1993, some 20 per­cent of ex­ec­u­tive com­pen­sa­tion was based on stock, ac­cord­ing to Lynn Stout of Cor­nell Law School. To­day, eq­uity ac­counts for about <a title=\"Executive pay.\" href=\"http://info.equilar.com/rs/equilar/images/equilar-2014-ceo-pay-strategies-report.pdf?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRojuKTNZKXonjHpfsX67%2BgqXrHr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy3YoITtQ%2FcOedCQkZHblFnV0PSq28UaoNoqIK%20\">60 per­cent of the re­mu­ner­a­tion</a> of ex­ec­u­tives at com­pa­nies in the Stand­ard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock in­dex. With so much mon­ey tied up in stock op­tions and the like, it is not sur­pris­ing that ex­ec­u­tives will do al­most any­thing to give their share price a boost re­gard­less of what costs this might in­cur af­ter their op­tions have vest­ed.</p> <p>These changes re­spond­ed to eco­nom­ic forces. The 1970s and 1980s were an era of high in­fla­tion, high in­ter­est rates and low re­turns on in­vest­ment. Glob­al­iza­tion was ex­pos­ing Amer­i­can com­pa­nies to much greater com­pe­ti­tion from abroad, putting pres­sure on mar­gins and re­dou­bling ex­ec­u­tives’ at­ten­tion on cost cut­ting and short-term prof­it­abil­ity.</p> <p>George East­man had a vest­ed in­ter­est in main­tain­ing a trained and mo­ti­vated work force in Roch­es­ter. Steve Jobs did not have much of a fac­tory work force to think of. An­other com­pa­ny halfway around the world made most of Ap­ple’s de­vices.</p> <p>Is there any hope that cor­po­rate ethics might swing back to some­thing re­sem­bling the ear­lier era?</p> <p>Cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives jump­ing on the “cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity” band­wag­on cer­tain­ly want you to think so. In 2000, 44 busi­ness­es <a title=\"Corprate Social Responsibility\" href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/JACF%20A%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Stories_f511f187-3656-4aa5-9a83-52988d5b5570.pdf\">signed up to the Unit­ed Na­tions’ glob­al stan­dards</a> on hu­man rights, work­ers’ rights, en­vi­ron­men­tal stew­ard­ship and an­ti-cor­rup­tion poli­cies. By last year, 7,717 had signed.</p> <p>Com­pa­nies, of course, are not char­i­ties. Their main re­spon­si­bil­ity is to re­main prof­it­able.</p> <p>Still, there is a case to be made that at­tend­ing to work­ers’ rights or en­vi­ron­men­tal deg­ra­da­tion might help the busi­ness in the long term. The hous­ing bub­ble and sub­se­quent fi­nan­cial cri­sis served as a stark re­minder of the con­se­quences of com­pen­sat­ing bankers based on short-term re­turns re­gard­less of whether their busi­ness would blow up a cou­ple of years down the road.</p> <p>More broad­ly, com­pa­ny ex­ec­u­tives are un­der a new form of pres­sure. George Ser­afeim of Har­vard Busi­ness School points out that the in­for­ma­tion age has brought greater trans­par­ency to cor­po­rate op­er­a­tions. Cus­tomers, in­vestors and em­ploy­ees know more about what busi­ness­es do around the world and can ex­ert in­flu­ence to change their be­hav­ior.</p> <p>Some prom­i­nent busi­ness­es, like the Amer­i­can re­tail­er <a title=\"Costco teh anti-Walmart.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/business/yourmoney/17costco.html?ex=1122696000&amp;en=4cd5686772a804b6&amp;ei=5070\">Cost­co,</a> the Dan­ish phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal multi­national No­vo Nordisk or the An­glo-Dutch food con­glom­er­ate Uni­lever ap­pear to take a se­ri­ous stand on broad­er so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues.</p> <p>None­the­less, it would be wise to tem­per ex­pec­ta­tions that cor­po­rate ethics are about to turn the cor­ner.</p> <p>Af­ter all, the mo­ti­va­tions go on­ly so far: No­ta­bly, pres­sure to “do good” from in­vestors, cus­tomers and em­ploy­ees is not like­ly to en­cour­age much good-do­ing in do­mains that in­vestors, cus­tomers and em­ploy­ees can­not read­ily see.</p> <p>Re­mem­ber En­ron? <a title=\"What motivates corporate social responsibility?\" href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/˜rbenabou/843%20final.pdf\">A re­port</a> by Jean Ti­role of the Toulouse School of Eco­nom­ics and Ro­land Bén­abou of Prince­ton Uni­ver­si­ty notes that even as the com­pa­ny was qui­etly cook­ing the books, it was vis­i­bly giv­ing mon­ey to all sorts of phil­an­thropies. “Com­pa­nies may be­have bet­ter where it is most vis­i­ble and not where it is less vis­i­ble,” Pro­fes­sor Bén­abou told me.</p> <p>Cor­po­ra­tions of an ear­lier era were just as mo­ti­vated by self-in­ter­est. East­man Ko­dak’s mi­ni-wel­fare state came about in part to keep unions at bay. Hen­ry Ford want­ed to en­cour­age his work­ers to be more pro­duc­tive and hoped that many would ul­ti­mate­ly be able to af­ford Model T’s for them­selves. But he al­so want­ed to limit the div­i­dend he would have to pay to the Dodge broth­ers, Ford share­hold­ers who need­ed the mon­ey to set up a ri­val car­mak­er.</p> <p>Wil­son’s pa­tri­otic take on G.M.’s in­ter­ests oc­curred at a con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing in which he was try­ing to con­vince sen­a­tors that he could be a fine de­fense sec­re­tary and still keep his G.M. stock.</p> <p>In­deed, there is a cor­ol­lary to Mil­ton Fried­man’s prop­o­si­tion: You can trust a busi­ness that mere­ly wants to turn a profit in a way that you can­not quite trust one that wants to change the world, too.</p> <p>“I don’t think we would get very far in ad­dress­ing large so­cial con­cerns if we left them to cor­po­ra­tions,” said Mar­garet Blair of Van­der­bilt Law School. “The eth­ic of share­holder val­ues is just too strong, and our so­cial prob­lems are just too big.”</p> <p>Elect­ed gov­ern­ments are cer­tain­ly im­per­fect. But to ad­dress our most in­tractable ills, they are the bet­ter tool.</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>When Dr. Her­bert Pardes re­tired as pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of NewYork-Pres­by­ter­ian Hos­pi­tal in 2011, the in­sti­tu­tion hon­ored him at its an­nu­al “Cabaret” fund-rais­er. More than 1,000 guests dined on wild mush­room soup catered by the restau­ra­teur Dan­ny Mey­er and lis­tened to Kel­li O’Hara, a star of “South Pa­cif­ic,” ser­e­nade them with Rodgers and Ham­mer­stein, Sond­heim and Berlin. </p> <p>But there were more thanks to come. </p> <p>The next year, Dr. Pardes earned $5.6 mil­lion, which in­clud­ed $1 mil­lion in base salary, a $1.8 mil­lion bonus for his fi­nal year as chief ex­ec­u­tive and more than $2 mil­lion in de­ferred com­pen­sa­tion, ac­cord­ing to hos­pi­tal tax records. That ex­ceed­ed the amount earned by Dr. Pardes’s suc­ces­sor, Dr. Steven Cor­win, who made $3.6 mil­lion that year.</p> <p>Three years af­ter re­tire­ment, Dr. Pardes is still em­ployed by the hos­pi­tal as the ex­ec­u­tive vice chair­man of its board of trustees, a po­si­tion that com­pen­sa­tion ex­perts say is rare in the non­prof­it world, though much more com­mon in for-prof­it com­pa­nies.</p> <p>“That’s a nice re­tire­ment present,” said Judy Wessler, the for­mer di­rec­tor of the Com­mis­sion on the Pub­lic’s Health Sys­tem, a New York City pa­tient ad­vo­ca­cy group.</p> <p>How much hos­pi­tal ex­ec­u­tives should be com­pen­sat­ed has been a mat­ter of de­bate for sev­er­al years and across the coun­try. A <a title=\"link to Harvard study\" href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1748832\">study last year</a> by re­searchers at the Har­vard School of Pub­lic Health found that in gen­er­al, ex­ec­u­tive pay bore no re­la­tion to pa­tient out­comes, like mor­tal­i­ty and read­mis­sion rates, and fre­quent­ly had more to do — at least in­di­rect­ly — with the bot­tom line.</p> <p>Sen­a­tor Charles E. Grass­ley, Re­pub­li­can of Iowa, who has been press­ing for tax-ex­empt hos­pi­tals to be more ac­count­able for the salaries they pay, said on Tues­day that Dr. Pardes’s com­pen­sa­tion was an ex­am­ple of how “ma­jor non­prof­it hos­pi­tals of­ten are in­dis­tin­guish­able from for-prof­it hos­pi­tals in their op­er­a­tions.” The sen­a­tor added: “It’s not enough to say high com­pen­sa­tion is nec­es­sary and leave it at that. A non­prof­it hos­pi­tal should show how that com­pen­sa­tion ben­e­fits its pa­tients.” </p> <p>Ex­ec­u­tive com­pen­sa­tion con­tin­ued to rise at ma­jor New York hos­pi­tals even af­ter the stock mar­ket crash of 2008. And Dr. Pardes may be lead­ing a trend. An­oth­er large hos­pi­tal or­ga­ni­za­tion, North Shore-Long Is­land Jew­ish Health Sys­tem, cre­at­ed the po­si­tion of ex­ec­u­tive vice chair­man of the board last year and filled it with Ralph Nap­pi, who had been pres­i­dent of the sys­tem’s foun­da­tion, its fund-rais­ing arm. “It’s a rel­a­tive­ly new ti­tle,” said Ter­ence Ly­nam, a spokesman for North Shore-L.I.J. Mr. Nap­pi earns $700,000 in base salary, and it has not been de­ter­mined if he will get a bonus, Mr. Ly­nam said.</p> <p>NewYork-Pres­by­ter­ian, one of the na­tion’s most pres­ti­gious hos­pi­tal chains, said Dr. Pardes, 80, was asked to stay be­cause of his close re­la­tion­ships with donors and his abil­i­ty to raise mon­ey and lob­by for aca­d­e­m­ic med­ical caus­es. His most re­cent pay will be pub­licly re­leased this year. Myr­na Man­ners, a hos­pi­tal spokes­woman, said that his com­pen­sa­tion had fall­en since 2012, but that he was still el­i­gi­ble for bonus­es.</p> <p>Frank A. Ben­nack Jr., the chair­man of the hos­pi­tal and for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Hearst Cor­po­ra­tion (and <a href=\"http://www.hearst.com/about/bios/frank-a-bennack-Jr\">ex­ec­u­tive vice chair­man</a> of the Hearst board, in a role sim­i­lar to Dr. Pardes’s), said in a state­ment that Dr. Pardes was “ex­tra­or­di­nary” and was kept on for “ur­gent fund-rais­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and a range of oth­er in­sti­tu­tion­al needs with which he could as­sist his su­perb suc­ces­sor.”</p> <p>The In­ter­nal Rev­enue Ser­vice re­quires that non­prof­it com­pen­sa­tion be rea­son­able and be based on doc­u­men­ta­tion of com­pa­ra­ble da­ta among sim­i­lar ad­min­is­tra­tors, but tax ex­perts said the I.R.S. rarely chal­lenged salaries.</p> <p>The hos­pi­tal’s tax re­turn, which is pub­lic be­cause the or­ga­ni­za­tion is a non­prof­it, said that in pay­ing its ex­ec­u­tives, NewYork-Pres­by­ter­ian looked at com­pen­sa­tion pat­terns in non­prof­it and for-prof­it health care sys­tems. Michael L. Wyland, a part­ner in a con­sult­ing firm to health care and oth­er non­prof­its, said that was per­mis­si­ble, be­cause “the I.R.S. ex­plic­it­ly al­lows com­par­i­son with for-prof­it as well as non­prof­it en­ti­ties.” </p> <p>Bonus pay, the tax re­turn said, is based on “op­er­a­tional and fi­nan­cial strength, pa­tient qual­i­ty and safe­ty, pa­tient sat­is­fac­tion, ad­vance­ment of pa­tient care and peo­ple de­vel­op­ment and part­ner­ship,” and may be award­ed on­ly if the hos­pi­tal earns a sur­plus.</p> <p>The tax fil­ing said Dr. Pardes, a psy­chi­a­trist by back­ground, worked 60 hours a week as ex­ec­u­tive vice chair­man, the same as the chief ex­ec­u­tive. Ms. Man­ners said he con­cen­trat­ed on fund-rais­ing and de­vel­op­ment, pub­lic pol­i­cy ini­tia­tives and ad­vo­ca­cy for aca­d­e­m­ic med­i­cine. (The NewYork-Pres­by­ter­ian sys­tem in­cludes two promi­nent aca­d­e­m­ic cen­ters, Weill Cor­nell Med­ical Cen­ter and Co­lum­bia Uni­ver­si­ty Med­ical Cen­ter, and serves mil­lions of pa­tients a year.)</p> <p>It is un­usu­al for a chief ex­ec­u­tive to stay on af­ter re­tire­ment, though, be­cause it can crimp the style of his suc­ces­sor to have a for­mer chief look­ing over his shoul­der. “To have a for­mer C.E.O. on the board is ac­tu­al­ly a big no-no,” said Uwe Rein­hardt, a Prince­ton Uni­ver­si­ty health care econ­o­mist. “It’s not con­sid­ered good board man­ners. In­evitably they be­gin to med­dle and mi­cro­man­age.”</p> <p>But Dr. Rein­hardt, who said he was friend­ly with Dr. Pardes, and Mr. Wyland agreed that while Dr. Pardes’s po­si­tion was un­usu­al, it might not be un­jus­ti­fied. They said that af­ter 12 years as chief, he had pre­sum­ably forged strong re­la­tion­ships with donors that the board would con­sid­er worth pay­ing hand­some­ly to main­tain.</p> <p>They said that run­ning a hos­pi­tal was as chal­leng­ing as run­ning many cor­po­ra­tions, be­cause doc­tors tend­ed to re­sent au­thor­i­ty and be­cause the job re­quired not on­ly man­age­ment skills but al­so an un­der­stand­ing of gov­ern­ment re­im­burse­ments, the in­sur­ance in­dus­try and med­ical and mal­prac­tice is­sues. </p> <p>And they said that in the con­text of a $3.7 bil­lion or­ga­ni­za­tion, Dr. Pardes’s salary would not af­fect the bot­tom line. </p> <p>“There might be oth­er rea­sons why one might call this a prob­lem,” Dr. Rein­hardt said. “Ob­vi­ous­ly, so­cial en­vy is one of them.” </p> <p>William Joseph­son, the for­mer head of the New York State char­i­ties bu­reau, said that with­out com­ment­ing di­rect­ly on Dr. Pardes’s salary, the prob­lem with non­prof­it com­pen­sa­tion was that un­der fed­er­al law, it is set by a closed fra­ter­ni­ty of or­ga­ni­za­tions and not tied to ob­jec­tive qual­i­ty mea­sures. “It’s tau­to­log­i­cal,” said Mr. Joseph­son, who has tes­ti­fied on the is­sue be­fore the Sen­ate Fi­nance Com­mit­tee.</p> <p>But the Har­vard study found in­stead that hos­pi­tal ex­ec­u­tive com­pen­sa­tion was more re­lat­ed to busi­ness fac­tors like size, lo­ca­tion, the pa­tient in­sur­ance mix and the use of tech­nol­o­gy.</p> <p>“There was no fi­nan­cial re­ward for pro­vid­ing good care; there was fi­nan­cial re­ward for get­ting peo­ple through the doors and fill­ing up the beds,” said Dr. Karen Joynt, an in­struc­tor at the Har­vard School of Pub­lic Health and co-au­thor of the study. </p> <p>Still, Dr. Joynt said she would not put a cap on salaries. “We want the best peo­ple, the best man­agers, in­no­va­tors, thinkers to be think­ing about ways to make health care bet­ter, and not ways to make mon­ey,” she said. “So I feel a lit­tle bit torn about what is the ‘right’ com­pen­sa­tion.”</p> <p>Dr. Pardes’s com­pen­sa­tion has con­sis­tent­ly been among the high­est of any New York hos­pi­tal C.E.O. His com­pen­sa­tion in 2011, his last year as chief ex­ec­u­tive, was $4.1 mil­lion, in­clud­ing base pay of $1.7 mil­lion and a bonus of $1.8 mil­lion. The oth­er three high earn­ers in the New York City hos­pi­tal sec­tor, ac­cord­ing to tax fil­ings, were Michael J. Dowl­ing, chief ex­ec­u­tive of North Shore-L.I.J., whose pay pack­age rose 83 per­cent from 2008 to 2012, to near­ly $4 mil­lion; Dr. Robert I. Gross­man, of NYU Lan­gone Med­ical Cen­ter, whose pay rose 70 per­cent over four years, to $4 mil­lion; and Dr. Steven M. Safy­er of Mon­te­fiore, whose pay rose 4 per­cent, to $4.4 mil­lion. The amounts in­clude base salary, bonus­es and de­ferred com­pen­sa­tion, like re­tire­ment pay. Na­tion­al­ly, the av­er­age non­prof­it hos­pi­tal chief earned $475,600 in to­tal com­pen­sa­tion, ac­cord­ing to da­ta com­piled by Com­p­da­ta Sur­veys.</p> <p>All of the hos­pi­tals said the pay was jus­ti­fied by the size of their sys­tems, which bring in sev­er­al bil­lion dol­lars of rev­enue a year.</p> <p>A spokes­woman for Dr. Gross­man said that he had presided over “an un­prece­dent­ed pe­ri­od of growth and in­no­va­tion” and that he did dou­ble du­ty as both C.E.O. of the med­ical cen­ter and dean of the School of Med­i­cine.</p> <p>Mr. Wyland, the con­sul­tant, said a rea­son­able salary would be based on the mar­ket and not on a sense of so­cial jus­tice. “There are peo­ple who use the rea­son­able­ness ar­gu­ment to jump to a whole is­sue about in­come in­equal­i­ty and ra­tios be­tween C.E.O.s and scrub nurs­es,” he said. “It’s a valid ques­tion, but it’s not a ques­tion that’s con­tem­plat­ed in the I.R.S. reg­u­la­tions.”</p> </div>",

Speak­ing by phone, res­i­dents said that 20 peo­ple were killed in the strike in­clud­ing 12 for­eign­ers of Cen­tral Asian or­i­gin and eight lo­cal mil­i­tants.</p> <p>The area where the strike oc­curred is con­trolled by Ha­fiz Gul Ba­hadur, a pro-Tal­iban mil­i­tant com­mander who avoid­ed at­tack for sev­eral years un­der an agree­ment with the mil­i­tary, but whose forces have been hit by fight­er jets in re­cent days as Pa­ki­stan ground troops move to­ward Dat­ta Khel, a cen­ter of mil­i­tant ac­tiv­ity in North Wa­ziri­stan.</p> <p>A se­cu­rity of­fi­cial con­firmed the drone strike, al­though there was some con­fu­sion over the tim­ing of the strike.</p> <p>The mil­i­tary says that over 400 mil­i­tants and at least 30 sol­diers, in­clud­ing two of­fi­cers, have died in the course of the month­long mil­i­tary op­er­a­tion. The fig­ures could not be in­de­pen­dent­ly ver­i­fied as there are few, if any, jour­nal­ists based in North Wa­ziri­stan.</p> <p>The mil­i­tary dri­ve to wrest con­trol of North Wa­ziri­stan is now ad­vanc­ing on two fronts, to the east and west of Mi­ram Shah. The se­cu­rity of­fi­cial in Pe­sha­war said that three sol­diers were killed in a fire­fight with mil­i­tants in Boya, 10 miles south­west of the town, on Tues­day. Two oth­ers died at the start of a ground of­fen­sive to seize con­trol of Mir Ali.</p> <p>The of­fi­cial said that ear­lier re­ports of the fight­ing on Tues­day, which sug­gest­ed that all five sol­diers had died in Mir Ali, were in­cor­rect.</p> <p>More than 900,000 civil­ians have fled the fight­ing, tak­ing up ref­uge in near­by tribal dis­tricts or across the bor­der in Af­ghan­i­stan.</p> <p>Sep­a­rate­ly, an Af­ghan court jailed a Pa­ki­stani jour­nal­ist for four years on charges of mak­ing con­tact with Pa­ki­stani Tal­iban fight­ers based in Af­ghan­i­stan, Agence France-Presse re­port­ed on Wednes­day.</p> <p>The pres­ence of Pa­ki­stani Tal­iban fight­ers in east­ern Af­ghan­i­stan is a sen­si­tive diplo­mat­ic is­sue be­tween the gov­ern­ments in Ka­bul and Is­lam­abad. Af­ghan in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials have ad­mit­ted pro­vid­ing some as­sist­ance to the Pa­ki­stani fight­ers, but de­scribe it as pay­back for years of Pa­ki­stani sup­port to the Af­ghan Tal­iban.</p> <p>Pa­ki­stani diplo­mats said they were try­ing to se­cure the re­lease of the jour­nal­ist.</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>BEIRUT, Leb­a­non — Fet­ed by sup­port­ers, whom he hailed as the vic­tors of his coun­try’s bru­tal civil war, a tri­umphal­ist Pres­i­dent Ba­shar al-As­sad was sworn in Wednes­day for a third seven-year term af­ter an elec­tion that was wide­ly seen as a ges­ture of cal­cu­lat­ed de­fi­ance to­ward the Unit­ed States and oth­ers in the West and in the Arab world seek­ing his ouster.</p> <p>With his right hand on the Quran, the holy book of Is­lam, Mr. As­sad took the oath at the so-called Peo­ple’s Pal­ace over­look­ing Dam­as­cus, the cap­i­tal.</p> <p>State-run tele­vi­sion broad­cast what it said was live footage of the Syr­ian leader ar­riv­ing in a black BMW se­dan as a mil­i­tary band played the na­tion­al an­them. Smil­ing and con­fi­dent, Mr. As­sad, 48, strode on a red car­pet and in­spect­ed an honor guard as he en­tered a hall crammed with law­mak­ers and oth­er dig­ni­taries.</p> <p>Since March 2011, an ini­tial­ly peace­ful up­ris­ing against him has turned in­to a bloody civil war claim­ing tens of thou­sands of lives. Mr. As­sad has faced an ar­ray of armed rebel forces, in­clud­ing sec­u­lar op­po­nents and Is­lam­ic fight­ers. Mil­lions of Syr­i­ans have been forced to flee their homes, ei­ther dis­placed with­in the coun­try or spilling over its fron­tiers as refugees in Jor­dan, Leb­a­non, Turkey and else­where.</p> <p>In his speech on Wednes­day, Mr. As­sad called his ad­ver­sar­ies “ter­ror­ists” — his usual la­bel for them — and urged them to “drop their weapons be­cause we won’t stop fight­ing ter­ror­ism and strik­ing it wher­ever it ex­ists in Syria.”</p> <p>There was no longer a place in the coun­try, he said, “for those who are wait­ing the end of the war from out­side. It is an il­lu­sion. The po­lit­i­cal so­lu­tion comes from the rec­on­cil­i­a­tion in­side.”</p> <p>While the rebels at first seemed to be tak­ing over swaths of the coun­try, Mr. As­sad’s forces have claimed in re­cent months to be turn­ing back the tide of in­sur­rec­tion, de­fy­ing West­ern and Arab de­mands that any po­lit­i­cal set­tle­ment should in­clude his de­par­ture from of­fice, a de­mand he has al­ways re­sist­ed.</p> <p>“They want­ed it to be a rev­o­lu­tion, but you have been the re­al rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies,” Mr. As­sad told his sup­port­ers on Wednes­day, ac­cord­ing to news re­ports. “Con­grat­u­la­tions for your vic­tory.”</p> <p>The in­au­gu­ra­tion fol­lowed close­ly-chore­o­graphed elec­tions in June in which Mr. As­sad was said of­fi­cial­ly to have won al­most 90 per­cent of the votes. “For many Syr­i­ans, the pres­i­den­tial elec­tions were like the bul­let di­rect­ed to­ward the chests of the ter­ror­ists,” Mr. As­sad said.</p> <p>The lat­est es­ti­mates of the num­bers killed in the war stand at about 170,000. In a state­ment on Wednes­day, the Syr­ian Ob­ser­va­tory for Hu­man Rights, which is based in Brit­ain and gath­ers in­for­ma­tion from con­tacts in Syria, said that since the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on June 4, 743 civil­ians had been killed, in­clud­ing 197 chil­dren and 108 women.</p> <p>Among those op­posed to Mr. As­sad is the Sun­ni mil­i­tant group Is­lam­ic State in Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS, which has ex­tend­ed its vic­tories in east­ern Syria and pushed across the bor­der in­to Iraq to de­clare an Is­lam­ic state.</p> <p>In east­ern Syria on Wednes­day, an an­ti-As­sad ac­tiv­ist who asked to be iden­ti­fied on­ly as Wis­sam said he was hid­ing in his home in the city of Deir al-Zour be­cause of the dom­i­nance of ISIS. Many sec­u­lar rebels have aban­doned the fray af­ter the ad­vances made by the Is­lamists in the re­gion.</p> <p>“In my opin­ion, Ba­shar has achieved po­lit­i­cal vic­tory,” Wis­sam said. “It is a bit­ter re­ality but I con­fess that As­sad man­aged to con­vince the world that his war is against ter­ror­ist groups. Af­ter all these sac­ri­fices, to­day As­sad came and took the lead­er­ship on a golden dish while the in­ter­na­tion­al com­mu­nity re­mained si­lent.”</p> <p>For their part, many Is­lam­ist fight­ers dis­missed Mr. As­sad’s speech. “Any per­son who thinks Ba­shar is the pres­i­dent is liv­ing un­der an il­lu­sion,” said one Is­lam­ist fight­er in Alep­po, de­clin­ing to give his name. “The prob­lem is no longer Ba­shar. It is the ca­liph­ate,” he said re­fer­ring to the mil­i­tants’ de­mand for rule by Is­lam­ic law.</p> </div>",

That wire broke, caus­ing the ac­ci­dent, the In­ves­tiga­tive Com­mit­tee, a pow­er­ful Russ­ian law en­force­ment or­ga­ni­za­tion, said in a state­ment.</p> <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors iden­ti­fied the de­tained men as Valery Bashka­tov and Yuri Gor­dov, who had been ser­vic­ing the rail­road tracks in the tun­nel. Au­thor­i­ties are prepar­ing un­spec­i­fied charges against the two, the state­ment said. The in­ves­ti­ga­tors were al­so ex­am­in­ing whether the con­tract­ing com­pa­ny that em­ployed the men was li­censed to work in the Moscow sub­way tun­nels.</p> <p>It was un­clear whether the Russ­ian work­men crimped the switch in place with wire to save mon­ey be­cause they lacked the ap­pro­pri­ate fas­ten­ers, or sim­ply as a tem­po­rary mea­sure un­til the new line opened.</p> <p>The In­ves­tiga­tive Com­mit­tee al­so raised on Wednes­day the death toll by two, to 22, from the to­tal of 20 re­port­ed on Tues­day. An­oth­er 136 peo­ple were hos­pi­tal­ized, some with grave in­juries.</p> <p>The de­rail­ing has be­come the grim talk of the Russ­ian cap­i­tal. About 56 per­cent of all com­muters ride the sub­way to work dai­ly, ac­cord­ing to city sta­tis­tics. Moscow’s may­or, Sergei S. Sobyanin, has made its ex­pan­sion a cen­ter­piece of his trans­porta­tion pol­i­cy. That has led to com­plaints about over­crowd­ing.</p> <p>Al­so touch­ing a nerve for the Rus­sians was the sug­ges­tion of a cav­a­lier at­ti­tude about safe­ty, a fa­tal­is­tic view — maybe that wire will hold, or maybe it won’t — that runs as deep in this coun­try’s cul­ture, and which many Rus­sians rec­og­nize all too well in them­selves.</p> <p>On the streets of the Russ­ian cap­i­tal, one of the largest cities in Eu­rope, man­holes go un­cov­ered, ici­cles plum­met on pedes­tri­ans in win­ter, and gi­ant sink­holes caused by faulty wa­ter pipe in­stal­la­tion open from time to time, swal­low­ing cars and peo­ple alike.</p> <p>In a ges­ture to nerve-jan­gled rid­ers, the en­tire metro sys­tem on Wednes­day sus­pend­ed the usu­al fare, the equiv­a­lent of about a dol­lar. About 9 mil­lion peo­ple ride the un­der­ground trains on most week­days. The sys­tem that opened in 1935 is among the largest in the world, famed for its el­e­gant sta­tions adorned with So­cial­ist Re­al­ist art.</p> </div>",

Lew said the ad­min­is­tra­tion sup­port­ed a quick fix that would halt the trend of so-called in­ver­sions, in which Unit­ed States com­pa­nies buy a small­er com­peti­tor and rein­cor­po­rate over­seas to save mon­ey on tax­es.</p><p>“The best way to ad­dress this sit­u­a­tion is through busi­ness tax re­form that low­ers the cor­po­rate tax rate, broad­ens the tax base, clos­es loop­holes, and sim­pli­fies the tax sys­tem,” Mr. Lew wrote. “But, even as we work to do that, we should pre­vent com­pa­nies from ef­fec­tive­ly re­nounc­ing their cit­i­zen­ship to get out of pay­ing tax­es.”</p><p>Mem­bers of the House and Sen­ate have made pro­pos­als to curb the in­ver­sion trend in re­cent months, and the pres­i­dent in­clud­ed a pro­vi­sion in the bud­get he pre­sent­ed to Con­gress this year that would have ef­fec­tive­ly banned the move. But none of these ef­forts have yet gained trac­tion.</p><p>Now, with the pace of in­ver­sions – and the size of com­pa­nies mov­ing abroad – in­creas­ing, the ad­min­is­tra­tion is urg­ing Con­gress to act fast. Mr. Lew sent the let­ter to Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Dave Camp, Re­pub­li­can of Michi­gan and the chair­man of the House Ways and Means Com­mit­tee; Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Sander Levin, De­mo­c­rat of Michi­gan, the rank­ing mem­ber; Sen­a­tor Ron Wyden, De­mo­c­rat of Ore­gon and chair­man of the Sen­ate Fi­nance Com­mit­tee; and Sen­a­tor Or­rin G. Hatch, Re­pub­li­can of Utah, the rank­ing mem­ber.</p><p>“Short of un­der­tak­ing a com­pre­hen­sive re­form of the busi­ness tax sys­tem, there are con­crete steps that Con­gress can take now that would ad­dress this ur­gent is­sue,” Mr. Lew wrote.</p><p>The Trea­sury sec­re­tary sug­gest­ed that Con­gress en­act leg­is­la­tion – ef­fec­tive im­me­di­ate­ly and retroac­tive to May – to halt in­ver­sions.</p><p>Mak­ing any new leg­is­la­tion retroac­tive through May could dis­rupt sev­er­al megadeals that have al­ready been struck.</p><p>Since May, Min­neapo­lis-based Medtron­ic agreed to ac­quire Co­vi­di­en for $43 bil­lion, and Pitts­burgh-based My­lan agreed to ac­quire as­sets from Ab­bott Lab­o­ra­to­ries. Both com­pa­nies plan to rein­cor­po­rate in Eu­rope as part of the deals. Ab­b­Vie, based in Chica­go, won pre­lim­i­nary ap­proval on Mon­day from the Irish drug mak­er Shire for a $53 bil­lion deal that would be the biggest of the year.</p><p>But if con­gres­sion­al lead­ers act, these deals could be in jeop­ardy. Many of the re­cent in­ver­sion deals in­clude claus­es that would al­low the buy­er to back out of the deal if the laws change to pre­vent them from rein­cor­po­rat­ing abroad.</p><p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­pears to be­lieve that po­ten­tial­ly scut­tling these deals would be worth push­ing through im­me­di­ate changes to stop in­ver­sions.</p><p>“The firms in­volved in these trans­ac­tions still ex­pect to ben­e­fit from their busi­ness lo­ca­tion in the Unit­ed States, with our pro­tec­tion of in­tel­lec­tu­al prop­er­ty rights, our sup­port of re­search and de­vel­op­ment our in­vest­ment cli­mate, and our in­fra­struc­ture, all fund­ed by var­i­ous lev­els of gov­ern­ment,” the let­ter said. “But these firms are at­tempt­ing to avoid pay­ing tax­es here, notwith­stand­ing the ben­e­fits they gain from be­ing lo­cat­ed in the Unit­ed States.”</p>  <p class=\"addendum\"><br/><b>Correction: July 16, 2014</b></p> <p>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a United States senator.

In a call with re­porters on Wednes­day, Bruce Thomp­son, the bank’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer, de­clined to say whether the large le­gal ex­pense was re­lated to a pos­si­ble Jus­tice De­part­ment set­tle­ment, but he ac­knowl­edged that “the D.O.J. is one of the sig­nif­i­cant re­main­ing mort­gage-re­lated mat­ters we have left.”</p><p>He al­so de­clined to com­ment on the sta­tus of the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p><p>Bank of Amer­ica’s le­gal charge comes af­ter <a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=C&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Cit­i­group</a> agreed to a record $7 bil­lion set­tle­ment with the Jus­tice De­part­ment on Mon­day.</p><p>Like Cit­i­group, Bank of Amer­ica has been wran­gling with fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors over the terms of its own set­tle­ment in an ef­fort to avoid a cost­ly law­suit.</p><p>The bank has been squir­rel­ing away re­serves for sev­eral quar­ters to pay for an as­sort­ment of lit­i­ga­tion ex­pens­es. But the charge an­nounced on Wednes­day most like­ly in­di­cates that the po­ten­tial price tag for set­tling with the Jus­tice De­part­ment has grown sub­stan­tial­ly.</p><p>The Jus­tice De­part­ment had been seek­ing as much as $17 bil­lion, which would prob­a­bly in­clude a com­bi­na­tion of a cash pen­alty and so-called soft dol­lar re­lief for con­sumers. Pros­e­cu­tors have warned the bank that they will file a law­suit if the bank does not sub­stan­tial­ly raise its of­fer, which at one point to­taled $12 bil­lion, though the vast ma­jor­ity was made up of “soft dol­lar” mea­sures.</p><p>It was the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive quar­ter that Bank of Amer­i­can had re­port­ed a large le­gal ex­pense. Dur­ing the first quar­ter, the bank post­ed its first quar­ter­ly loss in three years as it re­port­ed le­gal costs of $6 bil­lion, tak­ing many an­a­lysts by sur­prise.</p><p>Set­ting aside the le­gal mo­rass, Bank of Amer­ica re­port­ed some pos­i­tive re­sults, par­tic­u­lar­ly in its in­vest­ment bank.</p><p>Glob­al bank­ing prof­its rose to $1.4 bil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter from $1.3 bil­lion a year ago, fu­eled by strong eq­uity un­der­writ­ing fees. The bank’s glob­al wealth and in­vest­ment man­age­ment busi­ness al­so grew rap­idly. To­tal as­sets in­creased to $878 mil­lion from $743.6 mil­lion a year ago.</p><p>An­other bright spot: Bank of Amer­ica said its fixed-in­come trad­ing rev­e­nue in­creased 5 per­cent from the pe­riod a year ear­lier.</p><p>At <a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=JPM&amp;inline=nyt-org\">JP­Mor­gan Chase</a>, rev­e­nue from fixed-in­come trad­ing dropped by 15 per­cent, driven low­er by what the bank de­scribed as “his­tor­i­cal­ly low lev­els of vol­a­til­ity and low­er cli­ent ac­tiv­ity across prod­ucts.” Gold­man Sachs re­port­ed de­clines of 10 per­cent in fixed in­come, cur­ren­cy and com­mod­ities trad­ing in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p><p>Trad­ing rev­e­nue on Wall Street has plum­met­ed in re­cent quar­ters be­cause of low in­ter­est rates and tighter reg­u­la­tions. But for most banks, the de­cline in the sec­ond quar­ter has been less pre­cip­i­tous than many ex­ec­u­tives had warned.</p><p>As tra­di­tion­al profit cen­ters like trad­ing and mort­gage orig­i­na­tions shrink, Bank of Amer­ica and oth­er banks have ag­gres­sive­ly moved to cut costs, shed­ding em­ploy­ees and clos­ing branches.</p> </div>",

Ex­ot­ic cig­a­rette fla­vors like those were banned in 2009 out of con­cern they might tempt young peo­ple.</p> <p>But the fla­vors to­bac­co com­pa­nies once sold look like plain vanil­la com­pared with the fla­vor buf­fet now on of­fer — legal­ly — by the fast-grow­ing elec­tron­ic cig­a­rette in­dus­try.</p> <p>News on Tues­day that <a title=\"More information about Reynolds American Inc\" href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=RAI&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Reynolds Amer­i­can</a> had agreed to buy Lo­ril­lard, unit­ing two of the na­tion’s biggest to­bac­co com­pa­nies, high­light­ed how im­por­tant e-cig­a­rettes have be­come to the de­clin­ing to­bac­co in­dus­try. Both Reynolds and Lo­ril­lard have pushed hard in­to e-cig­a­rettes, which of­fer a new way of de­liv­er­ing a puff of nico­tine.</p> <p>For now, those com­pa­nies’ fla­vors are rel­a­tive­ly mod­est, though they may feel pres­sure to ex­pand in­to the ex­plo­sion of com­pe­ti­tion for the con­sumer palate, with e-cig­a­rette fla­vors such as ba­nana cream pie and cot­ton can­dy.</p> <p>Across the e-cig­a­rette in­dus­try, more than 7,000 fla­vors are now avail­able and, by one es­ti­mate, near­ly 250 more are be­ing in­tro­duced every month. The ar­ray of tastes goes far be­yond any­thing cig­a­rette com­pa­nies ever tried.</p> <p>Fla­vors have be­come cen­tral to the con­ver­sa­tion be­cause e-cig­a­rette mak­ers say that the rain­bow of tastes dif­fer­en­ti­ates them from dead­ly cig­a­rettes.</p> <p>But the claim that e-cig­a­rette fla­vors won’t at­tract chil­dren has prompt­ed an out­cry from some pol­i­cy mak­ers, who say con­sumers have been down this road be­fore with to­bac­co. Fed­er­al health au­thor­i­ties have out­lawed most cig­a­rette fla­vor­ings ex­cept men­thol, ar­gu­ing that they lure the young in­to nico­tine ad­dic­tion. While the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion has pro­posed reg­u­la­tions for e-cig­a­rettes, it has not lim­it­ed mar­ket­ing or fla­vors, which the agency is study­ing.</p> <p>At a Sen­ate com­mit­tee hear­ing in late June, law­mak­ers de­nounced man­u­fac­tur­ers for mar­ket­ing prac­tices that they said ap­pealed to chil­dren, in­clud­ing the em­brace of fla­vors that are for­bid­den in or­di­nary cig­a­rettes.</p> <p>“I’m ashamed of you,” Sen­a­tor Jay Rock­e­feller, De­mo­c­rat of West Vir­ginia, told sev­er­al ex­ec­u­tives. “You’re what’s wrong with this coun­try.”</p> <p>Ja­son Healy, the pres­i­dent of Blu eCigs, told the Sen­ate Com­mit­tee on Com­merce, Sci­ence and Trans­porta­tion that the av­er­age age of peo­ple us­ing cher­ry fla­vored e-cig­a­rettes, for ex­am­ple, was 40. Such fla­vors “de­crease the abil­i­ty or pos­si­bil­i­ty of adult users who use e-cigs switch­ing back” to cig­a­rettes, he said. Blu eCigs, a sub­sidiary of Lo­ril­lard, is be­ing sold to the British com­pa­ny Im­pe­r­i­al as part of the deal an­nounced on Tues­day. Lo­ril­lard and Reynolds said they would fo­cus their e-cig­a­rette ef­forts on Reynolds’ prod­uct Vuse, which in June was in­tro­duced in 15,000 stores na­tion­wide.</p> <p>For now, Vuse has on­ly two fla­vors, orig­i­nal cig­a­rette fla­vor and men­thol, but the mar­ket is chang­ing quick­ly as ev­i­denced by the ex­pe­ri­ence of oth­er lead­ing e-cig­a­rette com­pa­nies. Most no­table is the ex­pe­ri­ence of NJOY, which has turned to fla­vors to help stanch plum­met­ing mar­ket share.</p> <p>Ten months ago, NJOY’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, Craig Weiss, said in an in­ter­view that oth­er man­u­fac­tur­ers used fla­vor­ings “to at­tract chil­dren.” NJOY, he said then, was avoid­ing can­dy- and fruit-like fla­vor­ings, in part be­cause “they dri­ve reg­u­la­tors crazy.”</p> <p>NJOY’s in­vestors in­clude Sean Park­er, the Nap­ster co-founder and for­mer pres­i­dent of Face­book, and Bruno Mars, the pop star.</p> <p>But NJOY’s share of the con­ve­nience store mar­ket has gone in­to free fall, drop­ping more than half in the last year to less than 10 per­cent, ac­cord­ing to Wells Far­go Se­cu­ri­ties. Con­sumer sur­veys sug­gest that most peo­ple who use e-cig­a­rettes — in­clud­ing those who have smoked — tend to pre­fer fla­vors oth­er than to­bac­co. In the next few weeks, NJOY plans to ex­pand in­to fla­vors like “But­ter Crum­ble” and “Black and Blue Berry.” Mr. Weiss said in an in­ter­view that the com­pa­ny had lit­tle choice af­ter fo­cus groups showed that fla­vors were “crit­i­cal.”</p> <p>“Fla­vor is es­sen­tial to vapers’ sat­is­fac­tion,” Mr. Weiss said. He added that re­search fund­ed by his com­pa­ny showed that fla­vors “pro­vide no ad­di­tion­al ap­peal to youth.”</p> <p>The e-cig­a­rette mar­ket is rapid­ly shift­ing, and fla­vors are cen­tral to that. Viking Va­por, one of hun­dreds of web­sites sell­ing e-cig­a­rettes, of­fers 13 pages of al­pha­bet­ized fla­vors, from Ap­ple to Wa­ter­mel­on Men­thol. But the mar­ket for dis­pos­able e-cig­a­rettes, com­mon­ly found in con­ve­nience stores and sold by the likes of NJOY, Vuse and Blu eCigs, ap­pears to be slow­ing — con­sumers seemed to be switch­ing to more pow­er­ful de­vices, an­a­lysts said. Ac­cord­ing to Wells Far­go, con­sumer sales of e-cig­a­rettes at con­ve­nience stores fell 17 per­cent in the month that end­ed June 7, af­ter falling 10 per­cent the month ear­li­er — the first time since e-cig­a­rettes came on­to the mar­ket that con­sumers spent less at con­ve­nience stores. Wells Far­go hy­poth­e­sized that sales were grav­i­tat­ing to the In­ter­net and “vape” stores, where fig­ures are hard­er to mea­sure.</p> <p>Some in pub­lic health cir­cles see the de­bate over fla­vor­ings as a sideshow. The cen­tral ques­tion, they say, is whether e-cig­a­rettes are ef­fec­tive tools to get peo­ple to stop smok­ing to­bac­co. Oth­ers say the is­sue of fla­vors crys­tal­lizes the de­bate about the risks and ben­e­fits of these prod­ucts, which many con­sid­er far safer than con­ven­tion­al cig­a­rettes. At the same time, there is wide­spread con­cern that use of e-cig­a­rettes will renor­mal­ize the act of smok­ing and in­vite in a new gen­er­a­tion of par­tic­i­pants, par­tic­u­lar­ly through the lure of fla­vors.</p> <p>”It de­fies log­ic to think that such fla­vors would not make e-cig­a­rette use more ap­peal­ing and even nor­mal for chil­dren,” said James Pankow, a chem­istry pro­fes­sor at Port­land State Uni­ver­si­ty in Ore­gon, who has stud­ied can­cer risk from cig­a­rettes.</p> <p>Mr. Weiss of NJOY, hop­ing to ad­dress per­son­al con­cerns about fla­vors, fund­ed a study this year to see if the com­pa­ny’s new fla­vors would ap­peal to young non­smok­ers. The study, an on­line sur­vey con­duct­ed by Saul Shiff­man, a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try con­sul­tant and psy­chol­o­gy pro­fes­sor at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Pitts­burgh, found that young peo­ple were not par­tic­u­lar­ly at­tract­ed to the fla­vors. Fla­vors did make e-cig­a­rettes more at­trac­tive to adult smok­ers, Pro­fes­sor Shiff­man con­clud­ed.</p> <p>Sen­a­tor Richard J. Durbin, an Illi­nois De­mo­c­rat who has called for e-cig­a­rettes to be reg­u­lat­ed like con­ven­tion­al cig­a­rettes, said that those re­sults came as no sur­prise giv­en that NJOY paid for the re­search.</p> <p>“Let me be as dis­mis­sive as pos­si­ble: When they start talk­ing about their own re­search, I say ‘been there, done that,’ “ Mr. Durbin said in an in­ter­view. “We lis­tened to those to­bac­co com­pa­nies for decades while their so-called ex­perts tried to di­vert our at­ten­tion from the ob­vi­ous.”</p> <p>Mr. Weiss said NJOY did not in­flu­ence the find­ings. “I get the ap­pear­ance of a — ‘quote-un-quote’ — in­dus­try fund­ed study,” he said. “But we didn’t have time to get it fund­ed by a third par­ty.”</p> <p>In re­al­i­ty, the study took on­ly a few weeks, Mr. Shiff­man said, al­low­ing for the pos­si­bil­i­ty that oth­er stud­ies could be done quick­ly by in­de­pen­dent sources. Asked about that prospect, Mr. Weiss said: “What’s the mag­ic num­ber of stud­ies? Two stud­ies? Four stud­ies?”</p> <p>About a year ago, NJOY, based in Scotts­dale, Ariz., named to its board Dr. Richard H. Car­mona, the for­mer sur­geon gen­er­al who had been an ar­dent foe of to­bac­co com­pa­nies. Be­fore join­ing the NJOY board, Dr. Car­mona said he asked the com­pa­ny about the use of fla­vors and was told it “was not on the ta­ble at that time.”</p> <p>Dr. Car­mona, who al­so works at a non­prof­it health or­ga­ni­za­tion, the Canyon Ranch In­sti­tute, said that NJOY’s re­search was a good start but that it was crit­i­cal that in­de­pen­dent re­searchers val­i­date the find­ings. Like Mr. Weiss, Dr. Car­mona said he was will­ing to take the chance and go for­ward, giv­en that e-cig­a­rettes have the po­ten­tial to get peo­ple to stop smok­ing con­ven­tion­al cig­a­rettes.</p> <p>“Re­search like that could take months or years,” Dr. Car­mona said. “So we go with a the­o­ry, we go with a hy­poth­e­sis. It’s no dif­fer­ent than any oth­er mar­ket.”</p>  <p class=\"addendum\"><br/><b>Correction: July 16, 2014</b></p> <p>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a website selling e-cigarettes.

         ],
         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>MIN­NE­APO­LIS — In the fi­nal act of his fi­nal All-Star Game, Derek Jeter did some­thing that was quin­tes­sen­tial­ly him. Asked about his first at-bat here on Tues­day, and Adam Wain­wright’s in-game ac­knowl­edg­ment that he had de­lib­er­ate­ly given him a good pitch to hit, Jeter tried hu­mor to de­fuse a bub­bling con­tro­versy.</p> <p>Af­ter be­gin­ning with a se­ri­ous as­sess­ment of Wain­wright’s pitch­es, Jeter piv­oted sud­den­ly. “I don’t know, man,” he said, to laugh­ter. “If he grooved it, thank you. You’ve still got to hit it. I ap­pre­ci­ate that, if that’s what he did.”</p> <p>Jeter ripped a lead­off dou­ble to the right-field cor­ner off Wain­wright, then scored as part of a three-run in­ning to help lift the Amer­i­can League to a <a title=\"Box score.\" href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_07_15_nasmlb_aasmlb_1&amp;mode=box\">5-3</a> vic­tory over the Na­tion­al League at Tar­get Field. For the 12th year in a row, the win­ning league gets home-field ad­van­tage in the World Se­ries.</p> <p>Wain­wright is in­ti­mate­ly fa­mil­iar with the con­cept, hav­ing start­ed and lost Game 1 for the St. Louis Car­di­nals in Boston last fall. His team lost the ti­tle there to the Red Sox five games later.</p> <p>Yet when Wain­wright spoke with re­porters on Tues­day, af­ter pitch­ing one in­ning, he said he did not at­tack Jeter as he would a typi­cal op­po­nent. </p> <p>“I was go­ing to give him a cou­ple of pipe shots,” Wain­wright said. “He de­served it. I didn’t know he was go­ing to hit a dou­ble or else I would have changed my mind. I thought he was go­ing to hit some­thing hard to the right side for a sin­gle or an out. I prob­a­bly should have pitched him a lit­tle bit bet­ter.”</p> <p>Then Wain­wright, a ge­nial and can­did right-hander, laughed. But his ad­mis­sion un­der­scored the un­easy dy­namic of award­ing home-field ad­van­tage for the World Se­ries to the win­ner of an ex­hi­bi­tion game.</p> <p>“We’re a bet­ter team on the road, any­way,” said Jon­a­than Lu­croy, the catch­er for the N.L. Cen­tral-lead­ing Mil­wau­kee Brew­ers, smil­ing. “To me, it doesn’t mat­ter.”</p> <p>Lu­croy stepped be­hind the dirt cir­cle around the plate as a re­cord­ing of the late Bob Shep­pard, the ven­er­a­ble Yan­kees pub­lic-ad­dress an­nouncer, in­tro­duced Jeter’s first at-bat. As the crowd stood and roared for Jeter, Wain­wright stayed on the grass be­hind the mound, where he left his glove, and clapped.</p> <p>“He’s one of the best pitch­ers in base­ball,” Jeter said. “For him to do that says a lot about him and how much of a class act he is.”</p> <p>Fi­nally Wain­wright took the mound, and af­ter a ball, Jeter lashed a 90-mile-an-hour high fast­ball on a line for a dou­ble. He scored on a triple by the game’s Most Valu­able Player, Mike Trout, who came home on Mi­guel Cabr­era’s la­ser over the left-field fence.</p> <p>Wain­wright sug­gest­ed he could have sur­vived a hit by Jeter and still thrown a score­less in­ning. “I know I can put up a ze­ro to any­body at any time,” he said, and ex­plained how he want­ed it to play out.</p> <p>“I was hop­ing it would be the first pitch and he would take it,” Wain­wright said. “Then I would say, ‘All right, I piped him one and he didn’t swing,’ so I could go to it. But I spiked it in the dirt. I gave him one more shot, and un­for­tu­nate­ly he didn’t miss it.”</p> <p>The gift from Wain­wright — who later tried to take back his com­ments in an in­ter­view on Fox — called to mind a sim­i­lar pitch by De­troit’s Den­ny McLain in 1968, when an­other Yan­kee, Mick­ey Man­tle, was wind­ing down a sto­ried ca­reer. McLain had his catch­er, Jim Price, ask Man­tle where he want­ed a pitch. McLain oblig­ed and Man­tle slugged ca­reer homer No. 535, one more than Jim­mie Foxx. </p> <p>Back then, home-field ad­van­tage in the World Se­ries al­ter­nat­ed ev­ery year, and McLain’s Tigers had al­ready clinched the A.L. pen­nant. Base­ball be­gan award­ing it to the win­ning league in the All-Star Game in 2003. Since then, teams open­ing the World Se­ries at home have won 8 of 11 cham­pi­onships, in­clud­ing the last five.</p> <p>“We head­ed in­to Boston last year re­al­iz­ing we had our hands full al­ready with a very good team,” N.L. Man­ager Mike Ma­th­e­ny of the Car­di­nals said on Mon­day. “Any time you get in front of that home fan base, there’s an edge. Sta­tis­tics show it.”</p> <p>Af­ter the game on Tues­day, Ma­th­e­ny an­grily de­fended Wain­wright and chas­tised any­one who be­lieved what his pitch­er ini­tial­ly said.</p> <p>“All he want­ed to do is go out there and put up his best against Jeter,” Ma­th­e­ny said. “And un­for­tu­nate­ly, peo­ple couldn’t pick up the tone, pick up the hu­mor, and ran with it in the ex­act op­po­site, wrong di­rec­tion.”</p> <p>Jeter fin­ished his All-Star Game ca­reer with a .481 av­er­age (13 for 27) af­ter a sin­gle off Al­fre­do Si­mon in the third. He went back to short­stop for the top of the fourth, but be­fore Chris Sale’s first pitch, Alex­ei Ramirez took the field to re­place Jeter at short.</p> <p>Jeter point­ed to the N.L. dug­out as he left the di­a­mond, paus­ing be­fore the base­line and then step­ping over it, like Burt Lan­cast­er in “Field of Dreams,” cross­ing a thresh­old and know­ing he could not re­turn. That was the end of his All-Star Game ca­reer.</p> <p>With “New York, New York” play­ing over the loud­speak­ers, and his par­ents cheer­ing on the score­board, Jeter walked the length of the first base dug­out, ex­chang­ing hand­shakes and hugs with each of the play­ers and coach­es. He re­turned to the field for an­other ova­tion, tip­ping his cap — a gar­ish All-Star Game-on­ly ver­sion, with a white panel in the front — to the crowd.</p> <p>Af­ter the N.L. tied the game in the fourth, on Lu­croy’s sec­ond dou­ble, the A.L. went ahead for good in the fifth off the Car­di­nals’ Pat Neshek, a for­mer Twin. Sin­gles by Derek Nor­ris and Ramirez brought up Trout, who bounced a dou­ble down the left-field line to dri­ve in the go-ahead run. A sac­ri­fice fly by Jose Al­tuve, off Ty­ler Clip­pard, made it 5-3.</p> <p>That is how the score stayed, with A.L. Man­ager John Far­rell us­ing five re­liev­ers — al­though not the Yan­kees’ Dellin Be­tances — to col­lect the fi­nal 10 outs.</p> <p>The last was the Twins’ clos­er, Glen Perkins, a St. Paul, Minn., na­tive, who pitched to the Min­neso­ta catch­er, Kurt Suzu­ki. Perkins worked a 1-2-3 in­ning, and Jeter led the line of play­ers slap­ping five on the in­field af­ter the fi­nal out.</p> <p>Trout stayed on the field for a bit, se­lect­ing a Corvette over a truck as his M.V.P. prize. Trout, 22, was born in New Jer­sey, like Jeter, and seems to be his nat­u­ral heir as the icon of the game.</p> <p>Trout and Jeter spoke ad­mir­ing­ly of each oth­er af­ter the vic­tory, and Trout was asked about Jeter’s pregame mes­sage to the team. Jeter told the play­ers the ex­pe­ri­ence goes quick­ly, and urged them to en­joy ev­ery minute. </p> <p>“He just want­ed to thank us,” Trout said. “You know, we should be thank­ing him.”</p> </div>",
