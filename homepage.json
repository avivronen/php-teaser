         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>NEW­TOWN, Conn. — Adam Lan­za spent the last months of his life most­ly alone in his bed­room. His win­dows were cov­ered with black trash bags. He was pre­occu­pied with vi­o­lent video games and de­tails from some of the worst mas­sacres in Amer­i­can his­to­ry. </p> <p>Mr. Lan­za re­fused to speak even to his moth­er, com­mu­ni­cat­ing with her on­ly by email, even though their bed­rooms shared the same floor of their house on Yo­ganan­da Street.</p> <p>He would not eat un­less his food was arranged in a par­tic­u­lar way on his plate. He hat­ed birth­days and hol­i­days, and for­bid his moth­er from putting up a Christ­mas tree.</p> <p>He al­so made her get rid of a cat he did not like.</p> <p>No one else was al­lowed in­to his room, in­clud­ing his moth­er, who nev­er­the­less did her son’s laun­dry dai­ly be­cause he changed his clothes of­ten.</p> <p>Among their few out­ings to­gether were trips to the shoot­ing range. She was plan­ning to buy him a gun for Christ­mas last year.</p> <p>Mr. Lan­za, 20, could not con­nect with peo­ple but ob­sessed over “Dance Dance Rev­o­lu­tion,” an in­ter­ac­tive video game he played in the lob­by of a near­by movie the­ater, spend­ing as long as 10 hours at a time try­ing to fol­low dance rou­tines as they flashed on the screen.</p> <p>Four days be­fore her son killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook El­e­men­tary School and then shot him­self, Ms. Lan­za cooked him some of his fa­vor­ite meals and then left for a three-day trip to New Hamp­shire.</p> <p>Ms. Lan­za re­turned on Dec. 13 at 10 p.m.</p> <p>The next morn­ing, her son shot and killed her in her bed.</p> <p>A 48-page re­port re­leased by the Con­nect­i­cut State Po­lice on Mon­day of­fers a vivid and chill­ing por­trait of the young man re­spon­si­ble for one of the na­tion’s worst mass shoot­ings, and chron­i­cles his ram­page in the school.</p> <p>But what it does not an­swer is why. </p> <p>The long-await­ed re­port does not pro­vide a mo­tive for Mr. Lan­za’s ac­tions even as it of­fers a glimpse in­to his strange, trou­bled life. It comes near­ly a year af­ter the shoot­ing set off a na­tion­al dis­cus­sion about gun con­trol, men­tal health and vi­o­lence in Amer­i­can pop­u­lar cul­ture. </p> <p>In that time, fam­ilies of the Sandy Hook El­e­men­tary vic­tims have strug­gled to put their lives back to­gether, the town has tried to heal and the school has been razed. But, un­til Mon­day, lit­tle in­for­ma­tion com­piled by in­ves­ti­ga­tors had been pub­licly re­leased.</p> <p>Even ba­sic facts, like the path Mr. Lan­za took in­side the school, were kept se­cret.</p> <p>Af­ter the shoot­ing, the Con­nect­i­cut Gen­er­al As­sem­bly passed bills to limit what could be made pub­lic. The state al­so fought to pre­vent the re­lease of the record­ings of the emer­gency calls to 911 from peo­ple in­side the school. At a hear­ing on Mon­day be­fore the re­port’s re­lease, Judge El­iot Prescott of New Brit­ain Su­pe­rior Court said that he would re­view the tapes and soon de­cide whether to re­lease them.</p> <p>The re­port, which marks the end of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, was re­leased by Stephen J. Seden­sky III, the state’s at­tor­ney in Dan­bury. It is based on vo­lu­mi­nous ev­i­dence and in­ter­views con­duct­ed by the Con­nect­i­cut State Po­lice and the state’s at­tor­ney’s of­fice, along with fed­eral au­thori­ties.</p> <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors strug­gled to make sense of “con­tra­dic­tory” de­scrip­tions of Mr. Lan­za by those who knew him.</p> <p>The re­port notes that while “sig­nif­i­cant men­tal health is­sues” af­fect­ed his abil­i­ty to live a nor­mal life and in­ter­act with oth­ers, it re­mained un­clear if they con­trib­uted in any way to his ac­tions last De­cem­ber. Mr. Lan­za re­ceived a di­ag­no­sis in 2005 of an au­tism vari­ant known as As­perg­er syn­drome, but there is no ev­i­dence that peo­ple with As­perg­er’s are more like­ly than any oth­er group to com­mit vi­o­lent crimes.</p> <p>Mr. Lan­za was treat­ed by men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als, ac­cord­ing to the re­port, but none of them saw any­thing that pre­dict­ed his fu­ture be­hav­ior.</p> <p>“Tu­tor­ing, de­sen­si­tiza­tion and med­i­ca­tion were rec­om­mend­ed,” the re­port said. “The shooter re­fused to take sug­gest­ed med­i­ca­tion and did not en­gage in sug­gest­ed be­hav­ior ther­a­pies.”</p> <p>There were re­ports of trou­bling be­hav­ior as ear­ly as the fifth grade, when Mr. Lan­za pro­duced “The Big Book of Granny” for a class project. The main char­ac­ter had a gun in her cane and shot peo­ple.</p> <p>In 2006, when he was in the sev­enth grade, Mr. Lan­za was de­scribed by a teacher as in­tel­li­gent but ob­sessed with vi­o­lent im­agery.</p> <p>His moth­er not­ed a change in his be­hav­ior around that time. He stopped rid­ing his bi­cy­cle or climb­ing trees. He no longer showed in­ter­est in his sax­o­phone, drop­ping out of a school band. His life turned in­creas­ing­ly in­ward. </p> <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors found a wealth of dis­turb­ing digi­tal ev­i­dence at the Lan­za home, but were not able to re­cover any in­for­ma­tion from one hard dri­ve that he had de­stroyed.</p> <p>Mr. Lan­za had two videos show­ing sui­cide by gun­shot, a five-sec­ond video drama­ti­za­tion show­ing a child be­ing shot, and im­ages of Mr. Lan­za him­self hold­ing a gun to his head.</p> <p>He col­lect­ed in­for­ma­tion on gun vi­o­lence, in­clud­ing news­pa­per ar­ti­cles from 1891 “per­tain­ing to the shoot­ing of school­child­ren,” the re­port said. He used spread­sheets to chron­i­cle mass shoot­ings. He al­so had “ma­te­ri­als re­gard­ing the top­ic of pedo­philia and ad­vo­cat­ing for the rights for pe­dophiles.” The re­port made a point of not­ing that the ma­te­ri­als were not child pornog­ra­phy and the re­port did not oth­er­wise ad­dress pedo­philia.</p> <p>Mr. Lan­za was en­thralled by vi­o­lent video games, in­clud­ing one called “School Shoot­ing,” a mod­i­fied ver­sion of an­other on­line game. </p> <p>His moth­er, Nan­cy Lan­za, who sep­a­rat­ed from his fa­ther, Pe­ter Lan­za, in 2001, lived alone with Adam. She was con­cerned about him, say­ing she could not have a job be­cause he re­quired her con­stant at­ten­tion. It was un­clear how aware Ms. Lan­za was of his strong in­ter­est in death and vi­o­lence and she con­tin­ued to pro­vide him with weapons. </p> <p>“The moth­er want­ed to buy the shooter a CZ 83 pis­tol for Christ­mas and had pre­pared a check for that pur­chase to give the shooter,” the re­port said. “The moth­er nev­er ex­pressed fear of the shooter, for her own safe­ty or that of any­one else.” </p> <p>A spokes­man for the fa­ther said Pe­ter Lan­za was baf­fled by his son’s hos­til­ity to­ward him, and ev­ery at­tempt to reach out to the son was re­ject­ed. The two had not spo­ken in two years, said the spokes­man, who asked for an­o­nym­ity be­cause of the sen­si­tiv­ity of the events.</p> <p>As de­tails of the re­port were made pub­lic, there was dis­be­lief ex­pressed by some peo­ple that Ms. Lan­za could not have been aware of the dark­ness build­ing with­in her son.</p> <p>Michele Gay, whose daugh­ter Josephine was killed at the school, read the re­port and said of Mr. Lan­za’s bi­zarre be­hav­ior: “You would want treat­ment for some­one like that. The prob­lem here is that he was com­plete­ly iso­lat­ed from any­one but his moth­er, and the moth­er did not have the abil­i­ty or un­der­stand­ing to help her son.” Ms. Gay found it par­tic­u­lar­ly hard to fath­om why Ms. Lan­za would want to give her son a gun for Christ­mas, she said. </p> <p>By 2012, the re­port said, Mr. Lan­za was al­so es­tranged from his older broth­er, Ryan, who had al­so moved away. Ms. Lan­za was plan­ning to move from New­town, pos­si­bly to Wash­ing­ton or to North Car­o­lina, with Adam. To pre­pare the house for sale, she in­tend­ed to buy a rec­re­ational ve­hi­cle for Adam to sleep in be­cause he re­fused to go to a ho­tel.</p> <p>Mr. Lan­za care­ful­ly planned his at­tack. Ac­cord­ing to in­for­ma­tion from a GPS de­vice he owned, he drove to the vi­cin­ity of the school one day be­fore the as­sault, while his moth­er was out of town.</p> <p>When he went to Sandy Hook El­e­men­tary on Dec. 14, he was armed with 30-round mag­a­zines for a Bush­mas­ter .223-cal­i­ber ri­fle, along with sev­eral oth­er weapons. Short­ly af­ter 9:30 a.m. he blast­ed his way through the plate-glass win­dow at the locked front en­trance.</p> <p>In less than 10 min­utes Mr. Lan­za fired 154 rounds from the ri­fle, killing the 26 chil­dren and staff mem­bers. At 9:40, he took his own life with a pis­tol.</p> <p>“He was wear­ing a pale green pock­et vest over a black po­lo-style short-sleeve shirt over a black T-shirt,” the re­port said. “He had yel­low col­ored earplugs in each ear. He was wear­ing black car­go pock­et pants, black socks, black sneak­ers, a black can­vas belt and black fin­ger­less gloves on each hand. He had an emp­ty cam­ou­flage drop hol­ster that was af­fixed to his right thigh.”</p> <p>Fam­ily mem­bers of the vic­tims were per­mit­ted to view a draft of the re­port ear­lier this month.</p> <p>Af­ter near­ly a year of speak­ing with in­ves­ti­ga­tors, shar­ing stories with oth­er fam­ilies of vic­tims and end­less news me­dia ac­counts, some said there was lit­tle sur­pris­ing in the draft re­port. The fam­ily of Vic­toria So­to, a first-grade teacher whom Mr. Lan­za killed as she tried to keep her stu­dents out of the line of fire, re­leased a state­ment not­ing that there were some ques­tions that could nev­er be an­swered.</p> <p>“While oth­ers search for the an­swer as to why this hap­pened, we search for the how. How can we live with­out Vic­ki?” the state­ment read.</p> <p>“So, yes, we have read the re­port. No, we can­not make sense of why it hap­pened. We don’t know if any­one ever will. We don’t know if we will ever be whole again. We don’t know if we will go a day with­out pain. We don’t know if any­thing will ever make sense again.”</p> </div>",

Rice, im­posed an ul­ti­ma­tum on Pres­i­dent Hamid Karzai of Af­ghan­i­stan on Mon­day, telling him to stop his de­lay in sign­ing a se­cu­rity agree­ment or po­ten­tial­ly face the com­plete and fi­nal pull­out of Amer­i­can troops by the end of 2014, ac­cord­ing to Amer­i­can and Af­ghan of­fi­cials.</p> <p>But while Mr. Karzai was said to have as­sured her he would sign the deal at some point, he gave no time frame for it. And over din­ner at the pres­i­den­tial pal­ace in Ka­bul, he later in­sist­ed on dif­fi­cult new con­di­tions as well, in­clud­ing the re­lease of all in­mates at the Amer­i­can prison camp at Guan­tánamo Bay, Cu­ba, add­ing to the per­cep­tion of cri­sis be­tween the two na­tions, of­fi­cials from both coun­tries said.</p> <p>“Am­bas­sa­dor Rice re­it­er­at­ed that, with­out a prompt sig­na­ture, the U.S. would have no choice but to ini­ti­ate plan­ning for a post-2014 fu­ture in which there would be no U.S. or NA­TO troop pres­ence in Af­ghan­i­stan,” ac­cord­ing to <a title=\"The summary\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/11/25/readout-national-security-advisor-susan-e-rices-meeting-president-hamid-\">a sum­mary</a> of the meet­ing re­leased by the White House.</p> <p>The meet­ing comes a day af­ter Mr. Karzai <a title=\"Times article\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/world/asia/afghan-council-approves-us-security-pact.html\">re­ject­ed a rec­om­men­da­tion</a> from his own hand­picked as­sem­bly of Af­ghan lead­er­ship fig­ures, a loya jir­ga, that by year’s end he should sign the bi­lat­eral se­cu­rity agree­ment, which would al­low for an ex­tend­ed Amer­i­can mil­i­tary pres­ence in Af­ghan­i­stan af­ter 2014. Mr. Karzai told the loya jir­ga that he want­ed to wait to sign it un­til af­ter the Af­ghan pres­i­den­tial elec­tions next April, while con­tinu­ing to ne­go­ti­ate with the Amer­i­cans.</p> <p>In re­sponse, the White House sum­mary said, “Am­bas­sa­dor Rice stressed that we have con­clud­ed ne­go­ti­a­tions and that de­fer­ring the sig­na­ture of the agree­ment un­til af­ter next year’s elec­tions is not vi­a­ble, as it would not pro­vide the Unit­ed States and NA­TO al­lies the clar­ity nec­es­sary to plan for a po­ten­tial post-2014 mil­i­tary pres­ence.”</p> <p>Ms. Rice ar­rived in Af­ghan­i­stan un­der a cloak of se­crecy on Sat­ur­day, and the White House did not con­firm she was here un­til af­ter she was al­ready meet­ing with Mr. Karzai on Mon­day evening, along with oth­er top of­fi­cials from both Wash­ing­ton and Ka­bul, and Mr. Karzai’s sen­ior aides.</p> <p>The meet­ing last­ed sev­eral hours, and it con­tin­ued in­to what Aimal Faizi, Mr. Karzai’s spokes­man, who was there, de­scribed as a work­ing din­ner. And while the tone was said to be gen­er­ally diplo­mat­ic and po­lite, the pres­i­dent at one point be­came an­gry at the Amer­i­can am­bas­sa­dor, James B. Cun­ning­ham.</p> <p>Mr. Cun­ning­ham voiced ob­jec­tion to an ex­tra de­mand by the loya jir­ga: the re­lease of all Guan­tánamo in­mates. He in­sist­ed that Unit­ed States law gov­erns the re­lease of the pris­on­ers and that the is­sue had no bear­ing on the bi­lat­eral se­cu­rity agree­ment, or B.S.A.</p> <p>“That made the pres­i­dent very an­gry; his re­ac­tion was very strong and in­tense,” Mr. Faizi said. “The pres­i­dent said we can­not sep­a­rate the rec­om­men­da­tions of the loya jir­ga from the B.S.A. now — we can­not pick and choose. All those rec­om­men­da­tions have to be taken se­ri­ous­ly.”</p> <p>He was re­fer­ring to all 31 rec­om­men­da­tions is­sued by the loya jir­ga on Sun­day, the main one be­ing that the Af­ghan pres­i­dent should sign the agree­ment with­in one month.</p> <p>Near­ly all 50 com­mit­tees of the jir­ga rec­om­mend­ed that dead­line, while the oth­er rec­om­men­da­tions came from var­i­ous com­mit­tees and ran the gamut from al­low­ing Af­ghan ob­servers to at­tend Amer­i­can mil­i­tary tri­als to ban­ning Chris­t­ian re­li­gious ob­ser­vances on Amer­i­can mil­i­tary bases. An­other rec­om­men­da­tion was for an Amer­i­can mil­i­tary base in the re­mote prov­ince of Bami­an, the most peace­ful place in the coun­try.</p> <p>For her part, Ms. Rice warned Mr. Karzai that his re­fusal to sign the agree­ment would jeop­ar­dize West­ern aid to Af­ghan­i­stan, in­clud­ing an an­nual $4 bil­lion to sup­port its mil­i­tary, which is en­tire­ly de­pend­ent on Amer­i­can aid.</p> <p>“The lack of a signed B.S.A. would jeop­ar­dize NA­TO and oth­er na­tions’ pledges of as­sist­ance,” she told Mr. Karzai.</p> <p>She added that the Unit­ed States would “con­tinue to work with Af­ghan­i­stan to sup­port a smooth se­cu­rity tran­si­tion and to help en­sure free and fair elec­tions.”</p> <p>Mr. Karzai’s strong­est lan­guage was again said to be over the is­sue of Amer­i­can coun­ter­ter­ror­ism raids on pri­vate Af­ghan homes. De­spite hav­ing ap­proved in prin­ci­ple a se­cu­rity agree­ment that al­lowed for such mis­sions, with lim­its, in his ad­dress to the loya jir­ga on Sun­day, he in­sist­ed the raids should be banned im­me­di­ate­ly and com­plete­ly or he would can­cel the se­cu­rity agree­ment.</p> <p>Such raids are the main com­bat ac­tiv­ity re­main­ing to Amer­i­can forces in Af­ghan­i­stan now, and have been iden­ti­fied by Amer­i­can com­man­ders as a cru­cial, con­tinu­ing mis­sion.</p> <p>“The pres­i­dent in­sist­ed on the stance: a to­tal ban on home raids since yes­ter­day,” Mr. Faizi said. “He as­sured Ma­dame Rice they will get the B.S.A. signed — you will get a B.S.A. signed, but give the Af­ghan peo­ple time to see that the U.S. has changed its be­hav­ior, that home raids are banned in prac­ti­cal terms.”</p> <p>He said Ms. Rice de­ferred that is­sue to the Amer­i­can mil­i­tary com­mander, <a title=\"Times article\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/asia/gen-joseph-f-dunford-jr-takes-control-of-afghanistan-missions.html\">Gen. Jo­seph F. Dun­ford Jr.</a>, who as­sured that he had given in­struc­tions to his forces to “take all nec­es­sary mea­sures to avoid ci­vil­ian ca­su­al­ties and that the com­man­ders will be act­ing in ac­cord­ance to the rec­om­men­da­tions of the loya jir­ga and what is said in the B.S.A.,” Mr. Faizi said. But the Afghans were not sat­is­fied with that re­ply.</p> <p>The on­ly point of agree­ment from the talks, ac­cord­ing to Mr. Faizi’s ac­count, was on an­other de­mand that Mr. Karzai made dur­ing the se­cu­rity ne­go­ti­a­tions: trans­par­ency in elec­tions.</p> <p>Mr. Karzai was re­fer­ring to what he has called Amer­i­can in­ter­fer­ence in the 2009 pres­i­den­tial vote — when pres­sure by Amer­i­can of­fi­cials in re­sponse to al­le­ga­tions of elec­tion ir­reg­u­lar­ities led Mr. Karzai to agree to a sec­ond round of elec­tions — and Mr. Karzai’s de­mand that such in­ter­fer­ence not be re­peat­ed.</p> <p>“Once bit­ten, twice shy,” Mr. Faizi quoted him as telling Ms. Rice. “Ms. Rice gave good as­sur­ance to the pres­i­dent in this re­gard, that the U.S. has no in­ter­est in de­lay­ing the elec­tions, no fa­vor­ite can­di­date in the elec­tions, so in this re­gard the com­mit­ment was re­al­ly in strong terms, and this sat­is­fied the pres­i­dent.”</p> <p>Ms. Rice’s visit to Af­ghan­i­stan is her first for­eign trip since tak­ing over as Mr. Oba­ma’s na­tion­al se­cu­rity ad­viser in Ju­ly. She was sched­uled to leave Tues­day.</p> <p>Mr. Karzai ex­pressed his hope that Ms. Rice would con­vey his views to Pres­i­dent Oba­ma and then re­turn to ne­go­ti­ate the is­sues fur­ther, Mr. Faizi said.</p> <p>But the White House sum­mary made no men­tion of any fur­ther talks on the is­sue with Mr. Oba­ma, and made it clear the ne­go­ti­a­tions were con­sid­ered closed.</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>WASH­ING­TON — The week­end end­ed with the first tan­gi­ble sign of a nu­clear deal with Iran, af­ter more than three decades of hos­til­ity. Then on Mon­day came the an­nounce­ment that a con­fer­ence will con­vene in Jan­u­ary to try to bro­ker an end to the civil war in Syria.</p> <p>The suc­cess of ei­ther ne­go­ti­a­tion, both long sought by Pres­i­dent Oba­ma, is hard­ly as­sured — in fact the odds may be against them. But the two near­ly si­mul­ta­neous de­vel­op­ments were vivid state­ments that diplo­ma­cy, the ven­er­a­ble but of­ten-un­sat­is­fy­ing art of com­pro­mise, has once again be­come the cen­ter­piece of Amer­i­can for­eign pol­i­cy.</p> <p>At one level, the flur­ry of diplo­mat­ic ac­tiv­ity re­flects the de­fin­i­tive end of the post-Sept. 11 world, dom­i­nat­ed by two ma­jor wars and an epic bat­tle against Is­lam­ic ter­ror­ism that drew the Unit­ed States in­to Af­ghan­i­stan and still keeps its Pred­a­tor drones fly­ing over Pa­ki­stan and Yemen.</p> <p>But it al­so re­flects a broad­er scal­ing-back of the use of Amer­i­can mus­cle, not least in the Mid­dle East, as well as a will­ing­ness to deal with for­eign gov­ern­ments as they are rather than to push for new lead­ers that bet­ter em­body Amer­i­can val­ues. “Re­gime change,” in Iran or even Syria, is out; cut­ting deals with for­mer ad­ver­sar­ies is in.</p> <p>For Mr. Oba­ma, the shift to diplo­ma­cy ful­fills a cam­paign pledge from 2008 that he would stretch out a hand to Amer­ica’s en­e­mies and speak to any for­eign leader with­out pre­con­di­tions. But it will al­so sub­ject him to con­sid­er­able po­lit­i­cal risks, as the protests about the Iran deal from Cap­i­tol Hill and al­lies in the Mid­dle East at­test.</p> <p>“We’re test­ing diplo­ma­cy; we’re not re­sort­ing im­me­di­ate­ly to mil­i­tary con­flict,” Mr. Oba­ma said, de­fend­ing the Iran deal on Mon­day in San Fran­cis­co. “Tough talk and blus­ter may be the easy thing to do po­lit­i­cal­ly, but it’s not the right thing for our se­cu­rity.”</p> <p>Still, diplo­ma­cy is a pro­tract­ed, messy busi­ness with of­ten in­con­clu­sive re­sults. It is harder for a pres­i­dent to ral­ly the Amer­i­can pub­lic be­hind a mul­ti­lat­er­al ne­go­ti­a­tion than a mis­sile strike, though the deep war weari­ness of Amer­i­cans has re­in­forced Mr. Oba­ma’s in­stinct for ne­go­ti­ated set­tle­ments over uni­lat­er­al ac­tion.</p> <p>White House of­fi­cials sug­gest that the pres­i­dent al­ways planned to ar­rive at this mo­ment, and that ev­ery­thing that came be­fore it — from the troop surge in Af­ghan­i­stan to the com­man­do raid that killed Osama bin Laden — was clean­ing up af­ter his pred­e­ces­sor.</p> <p>“In 2009, we had 180,000 troops in two wars and a ton of leg­acy is­sues sur­round­ing ter­ror­ism,” said Ben­jamin J. Rhodes, a dep­uty na­tion­al se­cu­rity ad­viser. “So much that was done out of the box was wind­ing down those wars. We’ve shift­ed from a very mil­i­tary face on our for­eign pol­i­cy to a very diplo­mat­ic face on our for­eign pol­i­cy.”</p> <p>Much of that diplo­ma­cy has been on pub­lic dis­play in the <a title=\"Times article\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/world/middleeast/active-and-improvising-kerry-is-taking-on-tough-problems.html\">hy­per­caf­feinat­ed trav­els of Sec­re­tary of State John Ker­ry</a>, who, in ad­di­tion to his work on Iran and Syria, has per­suad­ed the Is­raelis and Pales­tini­ans to re­sume peace ne­go­ti­a­tions. A few hours af­ter seal­ing the nu­clear deal in Ge­neva, he flew to Lon­don for talks on the Syria con­fer­ence.</p> <p>But some of the cru­cial deal­ings have oc­curred in the shad­ows. In March, ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials said, Mr. Oba­ma au­tho­rized a small team of sen­ior of­fi­cials from the White House and the State De­part­ment to travel se­cret­ly to Oman, the Per­sian Gulf sul­tan­ate, where they met face to face with Ira­nian of­fi­cials to ex­plore the pos­si­bil­i­ty of a nu­clear deal.</p> <p>The cloak-and-dag­ger was nec­es­sary, the of­fi­cials said, be­cause it al­lowed the Unit­ed States and Iran to dis­cuss the out­lines of a nu­clear deal with­out fear that de­tails would leak out. Cut­ting out oth­ers elim­i­nat­ed the com­pet­ing agen­das that come with the six ne­go­ti­at­ing part­ners en­gaged in the for­mal Ge­neva talks. </p> <p>But the dis­clo­sure that the Unit­ed States and Iran had been talk­ing pri­vate­ly an­gered France, which reg­is­tered its dis­plea­sure two weeks ago by warn­ing that the pro­posal then be­ing dis­cussed was too le­nient and that it would not ac­cept a “suck­er’s deal.”</p> <p>For all of Mr. Oba­ma’s em­pha­sis on diplo­ma­cy, an­a­lysts not­ed that the Unit­ed States of­ten de­pends on oth­ers to take the ini­tia­tive. In the case of Iran, it was the elec­tion of Has­san Rouhani as pres­i­dent, with his man­date to seek a re­lax­ation of pun­ish­ing sanc­tions.</p> <p>In the case of Syria, it was a Russ­ian pro­posal for Pres­i­dent Ba­shar al-As­sad to turn over and de­stroy his chem­i­cal weapons stock­piles, an op­tion the White House seized on as a way of avert­ing a mil­i­tary strike that Mr. Oba­ma first threat­ened and then backed off from.</p> <p>“The C.W. deal made the Iran diplo­ma­cy much more vi­a­ble and at­trac­tive to the ad­min­is­tra­tion,” said Vali R. Nasr, the dean of the Johns Hop­kins School of Ad­vanced In­ter­na­tion­al Stud­ies and a for­mer Oba­ma ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial. But he added, “Nei­ther in Syria or Iran is there an am­bi­tion for some­thing larg­er.”</p> <p>Mr. Oba­ma has called for Mr. As­sad to give up pow­er. But his diplo­mat­ic ef­forts on Syria have done lit­tle to bring that about, and next month’s con­fer­ence in Ge­neva is like­ly to dem­on­strate that far from ne­go­ti­at­ing his de­par­ture, Mr. As­sad is dig­ging in.</p> <p>Sim­i­lar­ly with Iran, the ad­min­is­tra­tion is ad­a­mant that it is ne­go­ti­at­ing what amounts to an arms-con­trol agree­ment in re­sponse to a spe­cific se­cu­rity threat. A broad­er open­ing to Iran — one that could make it a part­ner on re­gion­al is­sues like Syria or Af­ghan­i­stan, or even open its po­lit­i­cal sys­tem — seems far-off.</p> <p>In a speech to the Unit­ed Na­tions Gen­er­al As­sem­bly in Sep­tem­ber, Mr. Oba­ma list­ed his pri­or­i­ties in the Mid­dle East as Iran, Syria, and the Is­raeli-Pal­es­tin­ian peace process. Pro­mot­ing de­mo­c­ra­t­ic prin­ci­ples, while still im­por­tant, was no longer an over­rid­ing in­ter­est.</p> <p>That more prag­mat­ic ap­proach was on dis­play ear­lier this month when Mr. Ker­ry vis­ited Egypt, where the mil­i­tary-backed gov­ern­ment is pros­ecut­ing its ousted pres­i­dent, Mo­hamed Mor­si, and crack­ing down on his Mus­lim Broth­er­hood sup­port­ers. Mr. Ker­ry stressed con­ti­nu­ity with Egypt’s gen­er­als and said lit­tle about their bru­tal tac­tics.</p> <p>For Mr. Oba­ma, all of this may mat­ter less than re­solv­ing the nu­clear threat from Iran, an achieve­ment that would al­low him to re­duce Amer­ica’s pre­occu­pa­tion with the Mid­dle East and turn to an­other of his for­eign-pol­i­cy pri­or­i­ties, Asia.</p> <p>“This was a pres­i­dent who was elect­ed on the prom­ise to wind down two wars re­spon­si­bly,” said Bruce O. Riedel, a for­mer ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial who is a sen­ior fel­low at the Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion. “He can now al­so say he has avoid­ed a third war.”</p> <p>Be­fore he can be sure of that, though, Mr. Oba­ma faces the treach­er­ous task of ne­go­ti­at­ing a fi­nal agree­ment. This time, the ad­min­is­tra­tion will have to do the bar­gain­ing with its part­ners, and it faces vo­cal skep­ti­cism from Is­rael and mem­bers of Con­gress.</p> <p>“The Iran talks are a four-ring cir­cus,” said R. Nich­o­las Burns, a for­mer un­der sec­re­tary of state who co­ordi­nated Iran pol­i­cy dur­ing the Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion. “This is go­ing to be among the most com­plex and dif­fi­cult diplo­mat­ic cases ever.”</p> <p>“We’re try­ing to deal with very dif­fi­cult, cyn­i­cal coun­tries through dif­fer­ent means,” said Mr. Burns, who now teach­es at Har­vard, where he has start­ed the Fu­ture of Diplo­ma­cy Project. “But the pub­lic is weary; they want us to work things out with­out fight­ing.”</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>Ter­roir is a con­cept at the heart of French wine­mak­ing, but one so mys­te­ri­ous that the word has no Eng­lish coun­ter­part. It de­notes the ho­lis­tic com­bi­na­tion of soil, ge­ol­ogy, cli­mate and lo­cal grape-grow­ing prac­tices that make each re­gion’s wine unique.</p> <p>There must be some­thing to ter­roir, given that ex­pert wine tasters can of­ten iden­ti­fy the re­gion from which a wine comes. But Amer­i­can wine grow­ers have long ex­pressed vary­ing de­grees of skep­ti­cism about this in­ef­fa­ble con­cept, some dis­miss­ing it as un­fath­om­able mys­ti­cism and oth­ers re­gard­ing it as a shrewd mar­ket­ing ploy to pro­tect the ca­chet of French wines.</p> <p>Now Amer­i­can re­searchers may have pen­e­trated the veil that hides the land­scape of ter­roir from clear view, at least in part. They have seized on a plau­si­ble as­pect of ter­roir that can be sci­en­tif­i­cally mea­sured — the fun­gi and bac­te­ria that grow on the sur­face of the wine grape.</p> <p>These mi­crobes cer­tain­ly af­fect the health of grapes as they grow — sev­eral of them ad­verse­ly — and they are al­so in­cor­po­rated in­to the must, the mashed grapes that are the start­ing ma­terial of wine­mak­ing. Sev­eral of the nat­u­ral fun­gi that live on grapes have yeast­like prop­er­ties, and they and oth­er mi­crobes could af­fect the me­tab­o­lism of the en­su­ing fer­men­ta­tion. (Sev­eral species of mi­crobes are avail­able com­mer­cial­ly for in­oc­u­la­tion along with yeast in­to wine fer­men­ta­tions.)</p> <p>But are the mi­cro­bial com­mu­ni­ties that grow on the grapes of a given re­gion sta­ble enough to con­trib­ute con­sis­tently to wine qual­i­ty, and hence able to ex­plain or con­trib­ute to its ter­roir?</p> <p>Such a ques­tion would have been hard or im­pos­si­ble to ad­dress un­til the de­vel­op­ment of two tech­niques that al­low the mass iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of species. One is DNA bar cod­ing, based on the find­ing that most species can be iden­ti­fied by an­a­lyz­ing a short stretch of their genome, some 250 DNA units in length. The oth­er is the avail­abil­ity of ma­chines that can an­a­lyze prodi­gious amounts of DNA da­ta at a rea­son­able cost.</p> <p>Armed with these new tools for study­ing mi­cro­bial ecol­ogy, a re­search team led by <a title=\"Staff bio\" href=\"http://mills.ucdavis.edu/david-mills\">Da­vid A. Mills</a> and <a title=\"Website\" href=\"http://mills.ucdavis.edu/nick-bokulich\">Nich­o­las A. Bokulich</a> of the Uni­ver­si­ty of Cal­i­for­nia, Da­vis, has sam­pled grape musts from vine­yards across Cal­i­for­nia. Grape va­ri­e­ties from var­i­ous wine-grow­ing re­gions car­ry dis­tinc­tive pat­terns of fun­gi and bac­te­ria, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/20/1317377110.abstract?sid=8f8cd724-4105-404f-ac6b-b1f4716426de\">they re­port­ed Mon­day</a> in The Pro­ceed­ings of the Na­tion­al Acad­emy of Sci­ences.</p> <p>They found, for in­stance, that one set of mi­crobes is as­so­ci­ated with chardon­nay musts from the Na­pa Val­ley, an­other set with those of a must in Cen­tral Val­ley and a third group­ing with musts from So­noma. They no­ticed a sim­i­lar­ly dis­tinc­tive pat­tern of mi­crobes in caber­net sau­vi­gnon musts from the north San Joaquin Val­ley, the Cen­tral Coast, So­noma and Na­pa.</p> <p>The dis­cov­ery of sta­ble but dif­fer­ing pat­terns of mi­cro­bial com­mu­ni­ties from one re­gion’s vine­yards to an­other means that mi­crobes could ex­plain, at least in part, why one re­gion’s zin­fan­del, say, tastes dif­fer­ent from an­other’s. The links be­tween mi­crobes and wine-grow­ing re­gions “pro­vide com­pel­ling sup­port for the role of grape-sur­face mi­cro­bial com­mu­ni­ties in re­gion­al wine char­ac­ter­is­tics,” the re­searchers con­clude.</p> <p>“The rea­son I love this study is that it starts to walk down a path to some­thing we could ac­tu­al­ly meas­ure,” Dr. Mills said. “There are high-end courses on ter­roir, which I think are bunk. Some­one has to prove that some­thing about ter­roir makes it to the bot­tle, and no one has done that yet.”</p> <p>Mi­crobes are de­pos­ited on the grape sur­face by wind, in­sects and peo­ple, and may fail or flour­ish be­cause of spe­cific lo­cal con­di­tions such as the way the grape vines are trained. And there may be ge­netic af­fin­i­ties be­tween par­tic­u­lar mi­cro­bial species and each va­ri­ety of grape, the re­searchers say.</p> <p>Even if Na­pa’s chardon­nay grapes, say, car­ry a dis­tinc­tive pat­tern of fun­gal and bac­te­rial species, the Da­vis sci­en­tists need still to prove that these mi­crobes af­fect the qual­i­ty of the wine. Mi­crobes could ex­ert an in­flu­ence both dur­ing the life­time of the grape and dur­ing fer­men­ta­tion, when they may add par­tic­u­lar in­gre­di­ents to the wine. “We will look at how over­all mi­cro­bial com­mu­ni­ties cor­re­late with qual­i­ty traits in the wine, and whether you can pre­dict qual­i­ty from the mi­crobes present,” Mr. Bokulich said.</p> <p><a title=\"Website\" href=\"http://wine.wsu.edu/faculty/thomas-henick-kling/\">Thomas Henick-Kling</a>, a pro­fes­sor of oe­nol­ogy at Wash­ing­ton State Uni­ver­si­ty, said it was plau­si­ble that mi­crobes are a com­po­nent of ter­roir. “Un­ripe grapes taste the same the world over,” he said. It is known that sin­gle strains of yeast can have a strong ef­fect on a va­ri­etal’s fla­vor, he con­tin­ued, “so it’s like­ly that mi­crobes play a larg­er role than pres­ently known and are prob­a­bly a part of the re­gion­al dif­fer­ences that we rec­og­nize.”</p> <p>While Dr. Mills said that “I make fun of ter­roir all the time,” he be­lieves that re­gion­al dis­tinc­tions be­tween vine­yards do ex­ist and that mi­crobes have a role in cre­at­ing them. If the spe­cific links be­tween mi­crobes and the sen­so­ry prop­er­ties of wine can be iden­ti­fied, grow­ers will be able to take a sa­voir-faire at­ti­tude to ter­roir in­stead of a je ne sais quoi shrug.</p> <p>On the oth­er hand, he added, pin­ning the qual­i­ties of wine on bac­te­ria and fun­gi may spoil that fris­son of en­chant­ment for some con­nois­seurs. “Many peo­ple don’t want this fig­ured out,” he said, “be­cause it de­mys­ti­fies the won­der­ful mys­tery of wine.”</p> </div>",

An au­gust com­mit­tee had for the first time re­lied on­ly on the most rig­or­ous sci­en­tific ev­i­dence to for­mu­late guide­lines to pre­vent heart at­tacks and strokes, which kill one out of ev­ery three Amer­i­cans. The group had worked for five years, un­paid, to de­velop them. Then, at the an­nual meet­ing of the Amer­i­can Heart As­so­ci­a­tion, it all went hor­ri­bly awry.</p> <p>Many lead­ing car­di­ol­o­gists now say the cred­i­bil­ity of <a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2013/11/11/01.cir.0000437738.63853.7a.full.pdf+html?sid=c405a901-ae13-404d-a3d5-80eeb8a3b0a8\">the guide­lines</a>, re­leased Nov. 14, is shat­tered. And the trou­bled ef­fort to de­vise them has raised broad­er ques­tions about what kind of ev­i­dence should be used to di­rect med­ical prac­tice, how changes should be in­tro­duced and even which guide­lines to be­lieve.</p> <p>“This was a cat­a­strophic mis­un­der­stand­ing of how you go about this sort of huge change in pub­lic pol­i­cy,” said Dr. Steven Nis­sen, a Cleve­land Clin­ic car­di­ol­o­gist who is a past pres­i­dent of the Amer­i­can Col­lege of Car­di­ol­ogy. “There will be a large back­lash.”</p> <p>What went wrong? Some crit­ics say the draft­ing com­mit­tee mis­tak­en­ly re­lied on­ly on ran­dom­ized con­trolled clin­i­cal tri­als, the gold stand­ard of med­ical ev­i­dence, but ig­nored oth­er strong da­ta that would have led to dif­fer­ent con­clu­sions. The group’s ef­forts were se­vere­ly un­der­fund­ed. And it an­nounced fun­da­men­tal changes in med­ical prac­tices with­out al­low­ing a pub­lic de­bate be­fore its guide­lines were com­plet­ed.</p> <p>“A lot of peo­ple ex­pect they can come up with guide­lines as a pure sci­en­tific dis­course and present them to the pub­lic,” said Dr. J. San­ford Schwartz. a com­mit­tee mem­ber and a pro­fes­sor at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Penn­syl­va­nia. “That’s what we did here, but the world has changed.”</p> <p>When the new guide­lines were re­leased, many doc­tors were shocked that they were sud­den­ly be­ing told to stop their decades-long prac­tice of mon­i­tor­ing lev­els of LDL cho­les­terol, the kind that in­creas­es the risk of heart at­tacks and strokes, af­ter pa­tients be­gin tak­ing statin med­i­cines.</p> <p>Oth­ers were stunned when a pair of Har­vard med­ical pro­fes­sors <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962388-0/fulltext#article_upsell\">of­fered ev­i­dence</a> with­in days of the guide­lines’ re­lease that its new <a href=\"http://my.americanheart.org/professional/StatementsGuidelines/PreventionGuidelines/Prevention-Guidelines_UCM_457698_SubHomePage.jsp\">on­line risk</a> <a href=\"http://my.americanheart.org/professional/StatementsGuidelines/PreventionGuidelines/Prevention-Guidelines_UCM_457698_SubHomePage.jsp\"> cal­cu­la­tor</a> great­ly over­es­ti­mat­ed a per­son’s chance of hav­ing a heart at­tack or stroke.</p> <p>The com­mit­tee writ­ing the guide­lines made a crit­i­cal, ear­ly de­ci­sion to con­sid­er on­ly ev­i­dence from clin­i­cal tri­als, a marked de­par­ture from how pre­vi­ous guide­lines were made. Some in­de­pend­ent ex­perts pro­vided with an ad­vance draft of the guide­lines, in­clud­ing Dr. Roger S. Blu­men­thal of Johns Hop­kins and Dr. An­to­nio M. Got­to Jr., a for­mer pres­i­dent of the heart as­so­ci­a­tion, ob­ject­ed. They said a wealth of ge­netic and pop­u­la­tions da­ta in­di­cat­ed that low­er cho­les­terol lev­els are bet­ter, es­pe­cial­ly for high-risk pa­tients. The same cri­tique would loom large af­ter the guide­lines were re­leased.</p> <p>Com­mit­tee mem­bers al­so said they strug­gled with in­ad­e­quate fi­nan­cial sup­port. They orig­i­nal­ly for­mu­lat­ed 18 im­por­tant ques­tions they would seek to an­swer. But it was soon ap­par­ent that they had over­reached and did not have near­ly enough mon­ey from the Na­tion­al In­sti­tutes of Health for such an am­bi­tious ef­fort.</p> <p>“It def­i­nite­ly was a fund­ing is­sue,” said Dr. Dan­iel J. Rader, a lipid spe­cial­ist at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Penn­syl­va­nia who was a com­mit­tee mem­ber for much of the time.</p> <p>And the mon­ey dwin­dled over time af­ter the Na­tion­al In­sti­tutes of Health un­der­went budget cuts. Ev­ery time the agency got hit, so did sup­port for the com­mit­tee draft­ing the guide­lines, said Dr. Eliz­a­beth G. Nabel, who was di­rec­tor of the heart in­sti­tute for much of the time. “This is one of the un­told con­se­quences of budget re­duc­tions,” she said.</p> <p>Even­tu­al­ly, the com­mit­tee whit­tled the 18 ques­tions to just three: Should doc­tors and pa­tients aim for spe­cific nu­meri­cal tar­get lev­els of LDL cho­les­terol? Should doc­tors use drugs oth­er than statins to dri­ve LDL lev­els down? And should there be tar­get lev­els for LDL plus oth­er forms of harm­ful cho­les­terol linked to car­dio­vas­cu­lar risk?</p> <p>They con­clud­ed that there was no ev­i­dence for tar­gets or for us­ing drugs in ad­di­tion to statins to low­er cho­les­terol.</p> <p>The Na­tion­al Heart, Lung, and Blood In­sti­tute con­tract­ed with two com­pa­nies to ex­haus­tive­ly re­view the sci­en­tific lit­er­a­ture — thou­sands of pa­pers sub­mitted by com­mit­tee mem­bers on those three ques­tions. Mean­while, the com­mit­tee met by tele­con­fer­ence most Wednes­days.</p> <p>The com­mit­tee chair­man, Dr. Neil J. Stone of the Fein­berg School of Medi­cine at North­west­ern Uni­ver­si­ty, who said he spent thou­sands of hours on the project and cut his fam­ily va­ca­tions short, sought con­sen­sus. Dis­cus­sions con­tin­ued un­til ev­ery vote was unan­i­mous. “You can in­sert the word ‘Tal­mu­dic,’ ” said com­mit­tee mem­ber Dr. Ron­ald Krauss of Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal Oak­land Re­search In­sti­tute. </p> <p>But there were signs, even be­fore the guide­lines were made pub­lic, that trou­ble lay ahead. The Na­tion­al Lipid As­so­ci­a­tion, which rep­re­sents spe­cial­ists in lipid dis­or­ders like high cho­les­terol, ini­tial­ly worked with the spon­sors of the guide­lines, but pulled out be­fore they were re­leased to the pub­lic, say­ing it could not en­dorse them. It dis­agreed with the aban­don­ment of LDL cho­les­terol tar­gets once pa­tients be­gan tak­ing statins.</p> <p>The guide­lines were em­bar­goed un­til just be­fore the an­nual meet­ing of the Amer­i­can Heart As­so­ci­a­tion. Some won­dered: Why the se­crecy? Why not fol­low the ex­am­ple of the U.S. Pre­ven­tive Ser­vices Task Force, a panel of in­de­pend­ent ex­perts that ad­vis­es the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, and re­lease a draft first for pub­lic com­ment?</p> <p>“I can’t an­swer that,” Dr. Stone said. “In ret­ro­spect that sounds fine. We will prob­a­bly do that the next time.”</p> <p>As it turns out, the pre­ven­tive ser­vices task force will soon be­gin work on its own ver­sion of cho­les­terol guide­lines and an­tic­i­pates fin­ish­ing with­in two years of its start date. When it pub­lish­es a draft of its rec­om­men­da­tions, it will al­low four weeks for pub­lic com­ment.</p> <p>Some ex­perts have raised the idea of a col­lab­o­ra­tive in­ter­na­tion­al ef­fort to de­vise guide­lines. Eu­rope has its own set, but coun­tries with­in Eu­rope use dif­fer­ent risk cal­cu­la­tors, said Dr. Mi­chael Lauer of the Na­tion­al Heart, Lung, and Blood In­sti­tute. “The way it works in Fin­land is dif­fer­ent from the way it works in Spain.”</p> <p>Dr. Seth Mar­tin at Johns Hop­kins asked in a <a href=\"http://cardiometabolic.cardiosource.org/Hot-Topics/2013/11/How-About-a-Worldwide-Effort-to-Collaborate-on-Developing-Guidelines.aspx\">post on the web­site</a> of the Amer­i­can Col­lege of Car­di­ol­ogy, “Couldn’t we do this bet­ter as a world­wide team than on our own?”</p> </div>",

Dink­ins, did not ex­act­ly re­turn the fa­vor.</p> <p>In an un­scripted and cringe-in­duc­ing mo­ment of po­lit­i­cal can­dor, Mr. Dink­ins opined be­fore a crowd of jour­nal­ists and aca­d­e­mics at Co­lum­bia Uni­ver­si­ty that Mr. de Bla­sio should con­sid­er a dif­fer­ent ap­proach to fund­ing an ex­pan­sion of prekinder­garten pro­grams, throw­ing a wrench in­to what was meant to be a care­ful­ly chore­o­graphed day of mu­nici­pal the­ater.</p> <p>Cit­ing skep­ti­cism in Al­bany, Mr. Dink­ins sug­gest­ed that Mr. de Bla­sio could turn to a tax on sub­ur­ban com­muters, rather than the <a title=\"A Times article on Mr. de Blasio’s plan.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/education/obstacles-seen-for-de-blasios-preschools-plan.html\">tax-the-rich plan</a> that be­came a cen­ter­piece of his may­oral cam­paign.</p> <p>“I think we might have more suc­cess with the oth­er one,” Mr. Dink­ins said, re­fer­ring to his com­muter plan, a com­ment that prompt­ed ap­plause from some mem­bers of the au­di­ence.</p> <p>On­stage, Mr. de Bla­sio kept a mirth­less smile on his face. “I take your point to heart,” he said.</p> <p>For Mr. de Bla­sio, a care­ful po­lit­i­cal or­ches­tra­tor, it was an awk­ward, un­wel­come ad-lib from a man whom, mo­ments be­fore, he had ef­fu­sive­ly praised, even jok­ing that Mr. Dink­ins de­served credit for his mar­riage, since he met his wife, Chirlane Mc­Cray, while both were serv­ing in the for­mer mayor’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p> <p>But it al­so served as an un­usu­ally pub­lic dis­play of the skep­ti­cism that Mr. de Bla­sio must now over­come as he rolls out an ag­gres­sive cam­paign to en­act the ed­u­ca­tion pol­i­cy that he views as <a title=\"A Times article on the policy.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-proposes-higher-taxes-on-wealthy-to-pay-for-education.html\">the top leg­is­la­tive pri­or­ity</a> — and a key po­lit­i­cal bench­mark — of his first year in City Hall.</p> <p>Re­spond­ing to Mr. Dink­ins, Mr. de Bla­sio in­sist­ed that rais­ing tax­es on the rich was the “right path and the at­tain­able path” to fund­ing prekinder­garten class­es, not­ing that Mr. Dink­ins him­self had per­suad­ed the State Leg­is­la­ture to ap­prove a tax in­crease that al­lowed the city to hire more po­lice of­fi­cers. (Mr. Dink­ins’s pro­posal raised tax­es on a broad swath of New York­ers, not just wealthy ones.)</p> <p>Af­ter his speech, the keynote ad­dress of an ed­u­ca­tion con­fer­ence, Mr. de Bla­sio ac­knowl­edged to re­porters that Gov. An­drew M. Cuo­mo, who would have to sign his plan in­to law, had sig­naled a de­sire to re­duce tax­es in the state, add­ing, “I re­spect that.”</p> <p>But Mr. de Bla­sio re­turned, sev­eral times, to the enor­mous mar­gin of vic­tory he en­joyed on Elec­tion Day against his Re­pub­li­can op­po­nent, say­ing his win rep­re­sent­ed “a clear man­date” by the pub­lic for his pol­i­cy plans.</p> <p>“I’m not go­ing to bar­gain against my­self,” Mr. de Bla­sio said. “The plan I’ve put for­ward is the best route both gov­ern­men­tal­ly and po­lit­i­cal­ly to get it done.”</p> <p>Mr. de Bla­sio said he would move swift­ly to gal­va­nize pub­lic sup­port for his pro­posal. He said he planned to ap­point a “work­ing group” to help him nav­i­gate the pol­i­cy mi­nu­tiae and the leg­is­la­tive leg­erde­main nec­es­sary to guide the bill through Al­bany.</p> <p>“I’m con­vinced this is the best way to get this done,” Mr. de Bla­sio said.</p> <p>Mr. de Bla­sio shrugged off a ques­tion about Mr. Dink­ins’s com­ments, say­ing he had been hear­ing pos­i­tive feed­back about his plans from many civic lead­ers.</p> <p>Still, in a sign of height­ened sen­si­tiv­ity, two of Mr. de Bla­sio’s top press aides hov­ered war­i­ly as Mr. Dink­ins met with re­porters.</p> <p>The for­mer mayor, sport­ing his usual bow tie, said he had sim­ply want­ed to raise an al­ter­na­tive plan given the Leg­is­la­ture’s usual in­tran­si­gence.</p> <p>“So many peo­ple dis­like the no­tion of tax­ing the rich for the poor. I don’t, but many do,” Mr. Dink­ins said.</p> <p>He ex­plained that the pub­lic forum had seemed an ob­vi­ous place to raise the is­sue. “I nev­er men­tioned it be­fore to him di­rect­ly,” Mr. Dink­ins said, “but it seemed like such an ex­cel­lent op­por­tu­nity, given all of the me­dia there.”</p> </div>",

Po­lice learned of it on­ly when the girl’s par­ents gave them a flash dri­ve two days later filled with graph­ic Twit­ter posts and video.</p> <p>“While this start­ed out be­ing about the kids, it is al­so just as much about the par­ents, about the grown-ups, about the adults,” said Mike DeWine, Ohio’s at­tor­ney gen­er­al, in an­nounc­ing the charges. </p> <p>The at­tor­ney gen­er­al of­fered no de­tails on Mon­day about what lead to the charges against the su­per­in­tend­ent, in­clud­ing fel­ony counts of tam­per­ing with ev­i­dence and ob­struct­ing jus­tice. </p> <p>But a per­son in law en­force­ment with knowl­edge of the grand ju­ry said the charges were re­lated not to the Au­gust 2012 rape, but to an ac­cu­sa­tion of an ear­lier rape, in April 2012, of a 14-year-old stu­dent, who came for­ward af­ter the pub­licity over the case in­volv­ing the foot­ball play­ers. </p> <p>Both cases have been han­dled by the at­tor­ney gen­er­al, who stepped in af­ter the lo­cal pros­ecu­tor re­cused him­self. </p> <p>On­line ac­tivists, in­clud­ing Anon­y­mous, a hack­er group, turned the case in­to a cause cé­lè­bre by ac­cus­ing the com­mu­nity of clos­ing ranks to pro­tect its ath­let­ic he­roes.</p> <p>Many in Steubenville, a strug­gling in­dus­trial town on the Ohio Riv­er bor­der with West Vir­ginia, re­sent­ed the scru­tiny, ac­cus­ing out­siders of paint­ing with too broad a brush.</p> <p>Af­ter a four-day tri­al in March, a judge con­vict­ed the two foot­ball play­ers, a for­mer quar­ter­back and a for­mer wide re­ceiver. </p> <p>The in­dict­ments against the el­e­men­tary school prin­ci­pal, Lynett Gor­man, 40, and a high school wrestling coach, Seth Fluhar­ty, 26, were on charges of fail­ing to re­port child abuse. A fourth adult, a for­mer as­sist­ant foot­ball coach, Matthew Bel­lar­dine, 26, was charged with al­low­ing un­der-age drink­ing and con­trib­ut­ing to the de­lin­quency of a mi­nor.</p> <p>In an in­ter­view last year, Mr. McVey said he did not speak to any stu­dents, or view the Twit­ter post­ings or In­sta­gram pic­tures, in the af­ter­math of the night of Aug. 11, 2012, when the 16-year-old girl, a stu­dent from West Vir­ginia who did not at­tend Steubenville High, was as­sault­ed. <a title=\"Times article.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ref=us&amp;pagewanted=all\">Mr. McVey said at the time that he was sat­is­fied that the head foot­ball coach, Reno Sac­coc­cia, would take care of the mat­ter</a> and dis­ci­pline his play­ers. </p> <p>Mr. Sac­coc­cia was not in­dict­ed. His win­ning Big Red teams are so pop­u­lar they reg­u­lar­ly fill the home­town side of a sta­dium known as Death Val­ley, whose 10,000 seats are more than half Steubenville’s pop­u­la­tion. </p> <p>At the tri­al of the two play­ers con­vict­ed in March, Trent Mays and Ma’lik Rich­mond, a text mes­sage was read from Mr. Mays stat­ing that he had per­suad­ed Mr. Sac­coc­cia “to take care of it” and that his coach “was jok­ing about it so I’m not that wor­ried.” </p> <p>Asked at a news con­fer­ence about the head coach, Mr. DeWine said he was for­bid­den to speak about the grand ju­ry in­ves­ti­ga­tion, which he praised as thor­ough. “Ev­ery pos­si­ble charge against any pos­si­ble in­di­vid­ual was con­sid­ered,” he said. </p> <p>Ear­lier, seem­ing to an­tic­i­pate the ques­tion, Mr. DeWine said: “Some may ask why oth­ers were not in­dict­ed. Un­der our sys­tem of jus­tice the grand ju­ry must have prob­a­ble cause to be­lieve all the el­e­ments of a crim­i­nal of­fense are present.” </p> <p>“It is sim­ply not suf­fi­cient that a per­son’s be­hav­ior was rep­re­hen­si­ble, dis­gust­ing, mean­spir­it­ed or just plain stu­pid,” he said. Mr. DeWine said he did not an­tic­i­pate fur­ther in­dict­ments, bar­ring new ev­i­dence. </p> <p>Robert Fitzsim­mons, a law­yer rep­re­sent­ing the vic­tim and her fam­ily, said the sys­tem had worked. “We’re very sat­is­fied with the de­ci­sion,” he said. That the head coach was not in­dict­ed af­ter be­ing the sub­ject of ru­mors, he added, “teach­es ev­ery­one we shouldn’t point fin­gers un­til the ev­i­dence is known.” </p> <p>If con­vict­ed, Mr. McVey could serve more than five years in prison. </p> <p>Mr. DeWine crit­i­cized both adults, who he said failed to set bound­aries for teenagers, and he crit­i­cized so­cial me­dia, for al­low­ing peo­ple to in­stant­ly spread in­for­ma­tion with­out re­spon­si­bil­ity. </p> <p>“Tech­nol­ogy makes it pos­si­ble to dis­sem­i­nate words and in­for­ma­tion, ei­ther true or false, at the push of a but­ton,” he said. “We don’t have to look each oth­er in the eye. An elec­tron­ic bar­rier di­vorces us from shame and from the hurt felt by oth­ers.”</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>Like a char­ac­ter who de­vel­ops a dis­creet but no­tice­able cough at the end of the first act, the movies have been dy­ing for a long time. The lat­est chap­ter in their de­cline — which be­gan, de­pend­ing on who is telling the story, with the in­tro­duc­tion of sound, the rise of tele­vi­sion, the fall of the old stu­dios, the spread of home video or the ar­rival of the In­ter­net — was writ­ten ear­lier this year.</p> <p>At the end of April (which counts, ac­cord­ing to the Hol­ly­wood cal­en­dar, as the be­gin­ning of sum­mer), Steven Soder­bergh gave a State of Cin­ema talk at the San Fran­cis­co In­ter­na­tion­al Film Fes­ti­val that was some­thing of a eu­logy both for his own ca­reer as a di­rec­tor of the­at­ri­cally re­leased fea­ture films and for the in­dus­try that sus­tained it. Ac­cord­ing to Soder­bergh, there is less and less room in the busi­ness for ar­tis­tic in­teg­rity and “speci­ficity of vi­sion”; in the age-old strug­gle be­tween art and com­merce, art is be­ing rout­ed. “You’ve got peo­ple who don’t know movies and don’t watch movies for pleas­ure de­cid­ing what movie you’re go­ing to be al­lowed to make,” he said. “That’s one rea­son stu­dio movies aren’t bet­ter than they are, and that’s one rea­son that cin­ema as I’m de­fin­ing it” — the art that some­times lives with­in the com­mer­cial husk of movies — “is shrink­ing.” Soder­bergh had ear­lier an­nounced that the psy­cho­log­i­cal thriller “Side Ef­fects” would be his last fea­ture dis­trib­uted to movie the­aters. His Lib­er­ace biopic “Be­hind the Can­de­labra,” though en­tered in com­pe­ti­tion at the Cannes Film Fes­ti­val, was made for and shown on Amer­i­can ca­ble tele­vi­sion (HBO in this case), where his fu­ture cin­e­mat­ic projects are like­ly to un­fold. The kind of work that he has been iden­ti­fied with ever since “Sex, Lies and Video­tape” — films that bal­ance main­stream ap­peal with am­bi­tion, in­tel­li­gence and a rec­og­niz­able cre­ative sig­na­ture — is in­creas­ing­ly mar­ginal in a sys­tem fo­cused on glob­al mar­kets and block­buster fran­chises.</p> <p>Soder­bergh’s grim di­ag­no­sis was quick­ly sec­ond­ed by George Lu­cas and Steven Spiel­berg, once easy scape­goats for the an­tiblock­buster, qual­i­ty-cin­ema move­ment and now pas­sion­ate, if some­what im­prob­a­ble, de­fend­ers of ar­ti­sanal, per­sonal film­mak­ing. At a wide­ly re­port­ed talk at the Uni­ver­si­ty of South­ern Cal­i­for­nia, they fore­told a “big melt­down” of the Amer­i­can film in­dus­try. Spiel­berg de­clared the cur­rent Hol­ly­wood busi­ness model, which lav­ishes huge bud­gets and mar­ket­ing mus­cle on su­per­hero tent-poles while forc­ing movies like “Lin­coln” to beg for crumbs, to be un­sus­tain­able. A sim­i­lar la­ment was of­fered by the pro­ducer Lyn­da Ob­st in her book “Sleep­less in Hol­ly­wood,” which anat­o­mized a “new ab­nor­mal” of fi­nan­cial anxi­ety and cre­ative pa­ral­y­sis, brought about by the col­lapse of the DVD mar­ket and oth­er eco­nom­ic and tech­no­logi­cal changes. Pan­ic over rev­e­nue has left the stu­dios “frozen,” she wrote, and the con­se­quences have to do with more than mon­ey: “The gut is frozen, the heart is frozen and even the bot­tom-line spread­sheet is frozen.”</p> <p>Did the box-of­fice chill that set­tled in through Ju­ly and Au­gust over some pricey flops bear out this pes­simism? Or did it of­fer a meas­ure of hope? As one big-budget ac­tion movie af­ter an­other fell short of ex­pec­ta­tions (at least do­mes­ti­cal­ly), you could hear whis­pers of mag­i­cal think­ing among film jour­nal­ists and oth­er con­cerned par­ties. Maybe the fail­ure of so many overblown, me­di­o­cre movies would in­spire the flow­er­ing of small­er, bet­ter ones. Maybe the au­di­ence, fed a steady sum­mer di­et of se­quels, mer­chan­dis­ing tie-ins and an­i­mat­ed fam­ily fun, was fi­nally say­ing “enough.” Maybe a les­son could be drawn from the suc­cess of the pre­vi­ous year’s crop of Os­car movies, and the fu­ture would be­long to the Ar­gos and Djan­gos and Lin­colns rather than the Avengers and Trans­form­ers.</p> <p>But maybe you tuned out all this chat­ter be­cause you were oth­er­wise oc­cu­pied: with the last five episodes of “Break­ing Bad,” the first sea­son of “Or­ange Is the New Black” or the roll­out of “Grand Theft Au­to V,” all of which seemed to loom much larg­er in the cul­tural dis­course of the late sum­mer than “The Wol­ver­ine,” “G.I. Joe,” “We’re the Millers” or “Planes.” It is no longer news that video games are, mea­sured in dol­lars and hours spent by the young, big­ger than movies. And the no­tion that tele­vi­sion is bet­ter, a pro­voc­a­tive claim just a few years ago, when the mem­ory of “The So­pra­nos” was still fresh and “The Wire” was wind­ing down, is now con­ven­tion­al wis­dom in the era of “Mad Men,” “Game of Thrones,” “The Walk­ing Dead” and “Girls.”</p> <p>The case for the su­prem­acy of tele­vi­sion is hard to re­fute: such an abun­dance of fine act­ing, com­plex sto­ry­tell­ing and, in­creas­ing­ly, vis­ual pol­ish, avail­able when­ever you want it, in sin­gle-episode or binge dos­es, on the screen of your choos­ing, with­out over­priced con­ces­sions and rude strangers tex­ting or talk­ing in the next row; a thriv­ing crit­i­cal ba­zaar of on­line re­cap­ping and wa­ter-cool­er plot-spoil­ing; a busi­ness model, free of re­li­ance on first-week­end gross­es, that en­cour­ages risk-tak­ing and the pa­tient cul­ti­va­tion of a de­vot­ed au­di­ence.</p> <p>Equal­ly hard to re­fute is the idea that we are ap­proach­ing a ho­ri­zon of video con­ver­gence, in which all those screens will be equal and in­ter­change­able and the dis­tinc­tions be­tween the stuff that’s shown on each one won’t seem as con­se­quen­tial as it does now. We still tend to take for grant­ed that a ca­ble dra­ma, a net­work sit­com, a fea­ture film, a web video and a first-per­son com­bat game are fun­da­men­tal­ly dif­fer­ent crea­tures, but they might re­al­ly be di­verse species with­in a sin­gle ge­nus, their vari­a­tions ul­ti­mate­ly less im­por­tant than what they have in com­mon. They are all mov­ing pic­tures, af­ter all, and as our means of ac­cess to them pro­lif­er­ate and re­com­bine, those old cat­e­go­ries are like­ly to feel in­creas­ing­ly ar­bi­trary and ob­so­lete. The in­fra­struc­ture of a mul­ti­plat­form fu­ture is be­fore us, and re­sist­ance to it can look like an es­pe­cial­ly tire­some kind of sen­ti­men­tal­ity. Cinephil­ia is nos­tal­gia. We might keep go­ing to the movies out of habit, or be­cause it’s some­times nice to leave the house, but we are los­ing the old, sus­tain­ing be­lief that this is a spe­cial and ex­alt­ed cul­tural ac­tiv­ity, the su­preme mode of par­tici­pa­tion in the pop­u­lar arts.</p> <p>And yet — this loss of pres­tige might turn out to be good for movies and, to bor­row Soder­bergh’s terms, for cin­ema. I’m not talk­ing about mar­ket share or the job se­cu­rity of ex­ec­u­tives or about the glam­our of red car­pets and the glit­ter of awards shows. My con­cern is with art and with the sur­vival of a com­plex and pro­tean form of vis­ual sto­ry­tell­ing that has con­sis­tently point­ed it­self in the di­rec­tion of the new.</p> <p>It is easy to con­clude that movies have sur­ren­dered that long-held van­guard po­si­tion. The cre­ative flow­er­ing of tele­vi­sion has ex­posed the com­pla­cen­cy and con­serva­tism that rules big-mon­ey film­mak­ing at the stu­dio level, the deep mal­aise that Soder­bergh, Spiel­berg, Ob­st and many oth­ers, aes­thetes and pop­ulists alike, have lament­ed. Au­di­ences are ex­pect­ed to see the same thing — the planet-shak­ing bat­tle of good and evil; the high jinks of over­grown boy-men; the ad­ven­tures of a plucky an­i­mat­ed crea­ture out to prove him­self in a world of ce­leb­rity voices — again and again, up to and past the point of ex­haus­tion. Win­ning for­mu­las and pop­u­lar brands (Pixar, Mar­vel, J.R.R. Tolkien, John­ny Depp) are run in­to the ground, stripped of nov­elty and mag­ic in pur­suit of profit. Vis­ual clich­és run amok. If the fight on the speed­ing train in “The Lone Ranger” wasn’t enough for you, there’s one in “The Wol­ver­ine.” At the cli­max of the lat­est “Star Trek” movie, Spock and Khan fight it out while San Fran­cis­co is smashed to pieces. In the Su­per­man re­boot, the Man of Steel and Zog do the same in Me­trop­o­lis. Does any­one care?</p> <p>But with­in this land­scape of bloat and des­o­la­tion, there is quite a lot worth car­ing about. More im­por­tant, there are film­mak­ers de­ter­mined to re­fine and re­in­vig­o­rate the me­dium, to re­cap­ture its new­ness and unique­ness and to fig­ure out, in a post-film, plat­form-ag­nos­tic, digi­tal-ev­ery­thing era, what the art of cin­ema might be. Like ev­ery pre­vi­ous pe­riod of de­cline — which is to say like just about ev­ery oth­er mo­ment in the past cen­tu­ry — this is an age of wild and rest­less ex­per­i­men­ta­tion. Maybe even a golden age.</p> <p><strong>One way that</strong> the movies have tra­di­tion­al­ly as­sert­ed them­selves in the face of small-screen com­pe­ti­tion has been to as­sert their greater size and scale. The ar­rival of com­mer­cial tele­vi­sion in the late 1940s sparked the de­vel­op­ment of wide-screen for­mats like Cin­e­maS­cope, the pro­mo­tion of gim­micks like 3-D and the in­creased pro­duc­tion of lav­ish Tech­ni­color projects too big and bright for the Amer­i­can liv­ing room. The re­cent re­turn of 3-D and the cur­rent as­cend­ancy of long, loud ac­tion movies is the lat­est it­er­a­tion of this strat­egy, and has been more or less suc­cess­ful in lur­ing fans to the mul­ti­plexes. The use of 3-D was al­so a way for the dis­trib­u­tors to en­tice the­ater own­ers in­to pay­ing for digi­tal up­grades, be­cause the the­aters could set, and keep, the 3-D tick­et pre­mium charged for the tem­po­rary use of Clark Kent-style glass­es.</p> <p>Af­ter an ini­tial burst of cu­ri­os­ity, how­ever, goosed by re­leases like “Av­a­tar” and “Up,” the au­di­ence’s in­ter­est in 3-D seemed to ta­per off. And then along came “Grav­ity,” which may be the first must-see 3-D mo­tion pic­ture of the dec­ade, and which both ful­fills the cri­teria of mod­ern movie spec­ta­cle and cuts against the grain of block­buster con­ven­tion. It is large be­yond imag­in­ing: the im­ages or­ches­trat­ed by the di­rec­tor, Al­fonso Cuarón and his cin­e­ma­tog­ra­pher, Em­man­uel Lubez­ki, are in­fi­nite in their depth and vast­ness. You see the whole earth in ce­les­tial chia­ro­scuro and feel the inky end­less­ness of out­er space. Ev­ery­thing floats — as­tro­nauts, their space­craft, a stray piece of hard­ware — and the view­er’s sense of the screen as a sta­ble, bound­ed plane dis­solves com­plete­ly. You are in the realm of the sci­ence-fic­tion sub­lime, a place fa­mil­iar to ear­lier gen­er­a­tions who had their minds blown by “2001: A Space Od­ys­sey” or their mytho­po­etic fun­ny bones tick­led by “Star Wars.”</p> <p>But you are al­so in in­ti­mate space and in the grip of a story that is fast, sim­ple and el­e­men­tal. The ma­chin­ery of vis­ual grandeur has been de­tached from the usual grind­ing ap­pa­ra­tus of mock pro­fun­di­ty that char­ac­ter­izes the fan­ta­sy and sci­ence-fic­tion gen­res. “Grav­ity,” a scant 90 min­utes long, is a sur­vival story, a tight lit­tle an­ec­dote about an in­di­vid­ual — San­dra Bull­ock’s NASA mis­sion spe­cial­ist Ryan Stone — us­ing her train­ing, her na­tive wit and her im­pro­vi­sa­tion­al skills to sur­mount a se­ries of ob­sta­cles. As such, it is al­so an al­le­gory of old-school, pre­cor­po­rate film­mak­ing, in which the wily art­ist has to re­ly on craft, tech­nique, dumb luck and sketchy equip­ment to ac­com­plish the im­pos­si­ble.</p> <p>Ev­ery movie about prob­lem solv­ing, whether a heist pic­ture or a man-against-the-el­e­ments melo­dra­ma, can be seen as a metaphor­i­cal ac­count of its own mak­ing. As they pro­lif­er­ate — “Grav­ity,” “All Is Lost” and “Cap­tain Phillips” ar­rived in the­aters this fall with­in a few weeks of one an­other — such stories add up to an al­le­gor­i­cal epic of cin­ema it­self, per­son­i­fied by an em­bat­tled un­der­dog who is al­so a pow­er­ful­ly com­pe­tent hero. Bull­ock’s soli­tary as­tro­naut, swirl­ing through chaos and cat­a­clysm with no help from Hous­ton and on­ly a ghost­ly men­tor for moral sup­port, is a por­trait of the art­ist as a scrap­py lon­er. So are Robert Red­ford’s ship­wrecked, name­less mar­i­ner in “All Is Lost” and Tom Han­ks’s hard-pressed Cap­tain Phillips.</p> <p>All of them stress the sin­gu­lar­ity of the cin­e­mat­ic en­ter­prise. At least in the fan­tasies these movies con­tain, there is no writ­ers’ room, no net­work hi­er­ar­chy, none of the com­forts and sec­ond chances of the long, se­rial form. The larg­er struc­tures on which the char­ac­ters de­pend — the si­lent, hulk­ing con­tain­er ships that pass by Red­ford’s char­ac­ter in “All Is Lost”; the in­ter­na­tion­al mil­i­tary-in­dus­trial com­plex that put Stone, her co-work­ers and a mil­lion tons of metal in­to or­bit; the U.S. mil­i­tary that turns Cap­tain Phillips’s res­cue in­to a lethal­ly ef­fi­cient ex­er­cise in overkill — rep­re­sent the pow­er­ful, soul­less stu­dios. They can ini­ti­ate, fi­nance or sup­port your mis­sion, but you can’t count on them to save you when things go wrong. At the movies, you have just one shot, and you’re al­ways on your own.</p> <p>In oth­er words, these movies are de­fi­ant fa­bles of au­teurism. It is ex­act­ly this prin­ci­ple — the su­prem­acy of the in­di­vid­ual art­ist — that the glob­al­ized Hol­ly­wood econ­omy is be­lieved to have threat­ened. Even though Soder­bergh has re­sist­ed the au­teur la­bel and has re­fused to take the “a film by” credit, the “speci­ficity of vi­sion” whose eclipse he warned against im­plic­itly be­longs to the di­rec­tor. And even though tele­vi­sion cur­rent­ly li­on­izes its show run­ners — some of whom, as Brett Mar­tin ar­gued in a re­cent book, may fash­ion their “dif­fi­cult” pro­tag­o­nists in their own im­ages — TV crit­i­cism has not yet erect­ed a cult of the in­di­vid­ual art­ist, whose in­ten­tions are leg­i­ble in the im­ages on screen.</p> <p>Cin­ema, in Soder­bergh’s for­mu­la­tion, is what hap­pens when some kind of per­sonal ex­pres­sion is vis­i­ble through the con­ven­tions of genre and the com­pro­mises im­posed by the var­i­ous con­tin­gen­cies of pro­duc­tion. No film­mak­er works in con­di­tions of per­fect free­dom. A great deal, from the sources of fund­ing to the par­tici­pa­tion of ac­tors to the weath­er on set, re­mains per­ma­nent­ly be­yond the di­rec­tor’s con­trol. But some man­age to as­sert them­selves, to draw the au­di­ence’s at­ten­tion away from the de­tails of the story or the cha­risma of the ac­tors to­ward some­thing more idio­syn­crat­ic, a pres­ence that is dif­fi­cult to iden­ti­fy but at the same time hard to miss.</p> <p>What movies en­able — what they may now, in fact, de­pend on — is the rad­i­cal as­ser­tion of di­rec­to­rial pres­ence, the re­fusal of any given film to con­form to the avail­able mod­els and dom­i­nant ex­pec­ta­tions. I am not talk­ing about avant-garde or ex­per­i­men­tal film­mak­ing here, or even about the will­ful quirk and stam­mer­ing so­lip­sism that pa­rades un­der the fad­ed, out­dat­ed “in­die” la­bel. I’m think­ing of the au­dacity of “Grav­ity,” with its big budget, big movie stars and huge box of­fice, and the even greater bold­ness of “All Is Lost,” which blithely ig­nores some of the most ba­sic ax­ioms of moviemak­ing. The cast con­sists of one per­son, who ut­ters a few dozen words and whose story is told with vir­tu­al­ly no ex­po­si­tion. We don’t know his name, his pro­fes­sion, his back story or any­thing else. Noth­ing has been done to make him re­lat­able or rep­re­sent­a­tive or uni­ver­sal, even as he be­comes all of those things.</p> <p>Tele­vi­sion, well es­tab­lished as a writer’s me­dium, de­pends on talk, and al­so on the in­ter­weav­ing of mul­ti­ple plot lines over the span of weeks and sea­sons. Ev­ery now and then, a se­ries will change up the rhythm with, for ex­am­ple, what is called a “bot­tle episode,” fo­cus­ing on a sin­gle se­ries of ac­tions in a con­fined space. (The “Girls” episode “One Man’s Trash,” in which Han­nah shacked up for a week­end with a brown­stone-dwelling doc­tor played by Pat­rick Wil­son, is an ex­am­ple, as is “Fly,” an hour of “Break­ing Bad” that nev­er leaves the cav­ern­ous un­der­ground meth lab where Walt and Jesse ply their trade.) But movies are freer to stay in one place, to nar­row their fo­cus and al­so to stray from the im­per­a­tives of lin­ear nar­ra­tion.</p> <p>“All Is Lost” may bear a the­mat­ic kin­ship with “Grav­ity” and oth­er chron­i­cles of sur­vival, but its more in­ter­est­ing coun­ter­part in the cin­ema of 2013 is Rich­ard Link­la­ter’s “Be­fore Mid­night,” the third in­stall­ment in the ro­man­tic ad­ven­tures of Ce­line and Jesse (Ju­lie Delpy and Ethan Hawke), who met on a train out­side Vi­enna 18 years ago and have not stopped talk­ing since. The for­mal rad­i­cal­ism of “Be­fore Mid­night” lies in its de­vo­tion to talk — di­gres­sive, in­dul­gent, fu­ri­ous, point­less — at the ex­pense of just about ev­ery­thing else. The words are as re­lent­less and re­mark­able as the si­lence that shrouds “All Is Lost.” The di­a­logue does not en­hance the ac­tion; it is the ac­tion. It doesn’t re­veal the char­ac­ters; it cre­ates them and cre­ates the il­lu­sion that what hap­pens be­tween them is spon­ta­neous, un­pre­dict­able and re­al.</p> <p>But the tire­less ver­bal back-and-forth be­tween Ce­line and Jesse al­so calls at­ten­tion to the won­der­ful ar­ti­fice they in­habit, a world that can­ni­ly evokes the cin­e­mat­ic past (the six moral tales of Er­ic Rohmer, the rough-and-tum­ble ’30s and ’40s Hol­ly­wood com­edies of mar­riage and re­mar­riage), even as it un­folds en­tire­ly in the present tense. The next episode might ar­rive nine years from now, or not at all, and this un­cer­tain­ty is part of what makes “Be­fore Mid­night,” stub­born­ly and ir­re­duc­ibly, a movie.</p> <p>Once you start to no­tice it, movieness is ev­ery­where. In the black-and-white rur­al land­scapes and pa­tient, el­lip­ti­cal com­ic move­ments of Al­ex­an­der Payne’s “Ne­braska”; in the black-and-white cityscapes and New Wave rhythms of Noah Baum­bach’s “Frances Ha”; in the art­ful­ly faked home movies that turn Sarah Pol­ley’s “Stories We Tell” from a per­sonal doc­u­men­tary in­to some­thing much weirder; in the im­prob­a­ble col­li­sion of styles (camp, melo­dra­ma, re­al­ism both mag­ic and kitchen sink) that pro­pels “Lee Daniels’ The But­ler.”</p> <p>You might end up watch­ing these at a the­ater, on a tab­let or in your den, cour­tesy of Net­flix or Bit­Tor­rent or your lo­cal ca­ble provider. But you will not be able to mis­take them for any­thing but movies. What is cin­ema? You know it when you see it.</p> </div>",

But it was no or­di­nary rob­bery. At the time, many of Rowan’s fam­ily and friends, in­clud­ing many mixed-mar­tial arts fight­ers, thought he had died a month ear­lier in a car ac­ci­dent. </p> <p>They be­lieved his girl­friend, Rosa Mar­tinez, when she told them that Rowan was dead — so much so that they or­ga­nized ben­e­fit fights in his mem­ory. </p> <p>But the death an­nounce­ment was a hoax, part of a clum­sy at­tempt to start a new life and es­cape a drug-re­lated debt that Rowan said was as much as $80,000.</p> <p>On March 18, Rowan and Mar­tinez robbed Guns and Stuff with the help of a friend, Mi­chael Bow­man. Rowan struck Rich­ard Robi­nette, the 75-year-old own­er of the store, with a ham­mer and stole eight hand­guns. </p> <p>Af­ter the rob­bery, Rowan and Mar­tinez went on the run. They were hid­ing out from the po­lice, fed­eral agents, the drug deal­ers to whom they owed mon­ey — and the cage fight­ers who re­al­ized they had been duped.</p> <p>Rowan and Mar­tinez were ar­rest­ed two days later. The strange case was the sub­ject of a long <a title=\"Tomato Can Blues\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2013/tomato-can-blues/\">ar­ti­cle pub­lished in Sep­tem­ber</a> in The New York Times.</p> <p>“All three of us de­served to be pun­ished for what we did,” Rowan said Mon­day in a phone in­ter­view from jail. </p> <p>“Un­for­tu­nate­ly, my life has been on a down­ward spi­ral for a few years,” he con­tin­ued. “And fi­nally, I just hit the bot­tom.

Her law­yer did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment. </p> <p>Bow­man, who plead­ed no con­test in con­nec­tion with the charges, is sched­uled to be sen­tenced in Jan­u­ary.</p> <p>“Five min­utes just changed two decades of my life, the rest of my life, the rest of ev­ery­one else’s,” Rowan said. </p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>Ten for­mer N.H.L. play­ers sued the league Mon­day for neg­li­gence and fraud, say­ing the sport’s of­fi­cials should have done more to ad­dress head in­ju­ries but in­stead cel­e­brated a cul­ture of speed and vi­o­lence.</p> <p>The play­ers, who were in the league in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, filed their suit in fed­eral court in Wash­ing­ton. One of the lead lawyers is Mel Ow­ens, a for­mer N.F.L. player who has rep­re­sent­ed scores of oth­er re­tired play­ers in work­ers’ com­pen­sa­tion cases.</p> <p>The hock­ey play­ers range from role play­ers to stars like Rick Vaive, who scored more than 400 goals in 14 sea­sons. One player in the suit, Dar­ren Banks, was de­scribed as an en­forcer. The play­ers claim to have sus­tained re­peat­ed hits to the head dur­ing their ca­reers and now have de­pres­sion, headaches and mem­ory loss.</p> <p>One player, Mor­ris Ti­tan­tic, reached at his home near Buf­fa­lo, de­clined to com­ment and re­ferred all ques­tions to his lawyers. </p> <p>The suit comes about three months af­ter the N.F.L. agreed to pay $765 mil­lion to set­tle hun­dreds of cases brought by more than 4,000 re­tired play­ers who said the league knew about the dan­gers of re­peat­ed head hits but failed to prop­erly warn the play­ers. Sim­i­lar suits have been filed against the N.C.A.A.</p> <p>In seek­ing un­speci­fied com­pen­sa­tory and pu­ni­tive dam­ages, the play­ers said in their com­plaint that the N.H.L. “knew or should have been aware” of the ef­fects of head hits but “took no re­me­dial ac­tion to pre­vent its play­ers from un­nec­es­sary harm” un­til 1997, when the league cre­ated a pro­gram to re­search and study brain in­ju­ries. Even then, the suit said, “the N.H.L. took no ac­tion to re­duce the num­ber and se­ver­ity of con­cus­sions among its play­ers dur­ing that pe­riod and Plain­tiffs re­lied on the N.H.L.’s si­lence to their det­ri­ment.”</p> <p>Ow­ens and oth­er lawyers said in a state­ment, “The N.H.L. con­tin­ues to glo­rify and em­power play­ers known as ‘en­forcers’ — play­ers with the sin­gu­lar in­ten­tion of in­jur­ing the op­pos­ing team.”</p> <p>Bill Daly, the N.H.L.’s dep­uty com­mis­sion­er, said in a state­ment: “While the sub­ject mat­ter is very se­ri­ous, we are com­plete­ly sat­is­fied with the re­spon­si­ble man­ner in which the league and the play­ers as­so­ci­a­tion have man­aged player safe­ty over time, in­clud­ing with re­spect to head in­ju­ries and con­cus­sions. We in­tend to de­fend the case vig­or­ous­ly and have no fur­ther com­ment at this time.”</p> <p>Though hock­ey play­ers have sus­tained con­cus­sions and oth­er head in­ju­ries for gen­er­a­tions, the N.H.L. faced less scru­tiny about its poli­cies than the N.F.L. The N.H.L. set up a con­cus­sion study pro­gram in 1997, the first in North Amer­i­can ma­jor league sports, and has in re­cent years mod­i­fied rules in re­sponse to in­creased con­cern about head trau­ma. </p> <p>In May, the fam­ily of Derek Boogaard filed a wrong­ful-death law­suit against the N.H.L., say­ing the league was re­spon­si­ble for the phys­i­cal trau­ma and brain dam­age Boogaard sus­tained in six sea­sons as one of the league’s top en­forcers. Boogaard was found dead of an ac­ci­den­tal over­dose of pre­scrip­tion painkillers and al­co­hol in 2011. He was posthu­mous­ly found to have chron­ic trau­mat­ic en­ceph­a­lop­a­thy, or C.T.E., a brain dis­ease thought to be caused by re­peat­ed blows to the head.</p> <p>The suits brought by re­tired N.F.L. play­ers were orig­i­nal­ly filed in states around the coun­try over many months. They were even­tu­al­ly con­soli­dated and heard in fed­eral court in Phil­a­del­phia. Play­ers will soon de­cide whether they want to ap­prove the pro­posed set­tle­ment.</p> </div>",

The sur­pris­ing new find­ing has not been rep­li­cated in peo­ple, but sci­en­tists say it may pro­vide an im­por­tant clue to a puz­zling spike in the in­ci­dence of whoop­ing cough across the coun­try, which reached a 50-year high last year.</p> <p>The whoop­ing cough vac­cines now in use were in­tro­duced in the 1990s af­ter an older ver­sion, which of­fered longer-last­ing pro­tec­tion, was found to have side ef­fects. But over the years, sci­en­tists have de­ter­mined that the new vac­cines be­gan to lose ef­fec­tive­ness af­ter about five years, a sig­nif­i­cant prob­lem that many re­searchers be­lieve has con­trib­uted to the sig­nif­i­cant rise in whoop­ing cough cases.</p> <p>The new study, <a title=\"The study.\" href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/20/1314688110\">pub­lished on Mon­day </a>in Pro­ceed­ings of the Na­tion­al Acad­emy of Sci­ences, of­fers an­other ex­pla­na­tion. Us­ing ba­boons, the re­searchers found that re­cent­ly vac­ci­nat­ed an­i­mals con­tin­ued to car­ry the in­fec­tion in their throats. Even though those ba­boons did not get sick from it, they spread the in­fec­tion to oth­ers that were not vac­ci­nat­ed.</p> <p>“When you’re new­ly vac­ci­nat­ed you are an asymp­tom­atic car­rier, which is good for you, but not for the pop­u­la­tion,” said Tod J. Merkel, the lead au­thor of the study, who is a re­searcher in the Of­fice of Vac­cines Re­search and Re­view in the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p> <p>Sci­en­tists said the find­ing was sur­pris­ing, and could be a sign­post for in­ves­ti­ga­tors as they try to im­prove the vac­cines for peo­ple.</p> <p>“If Dr. Merkel is cor­rect, then we need to de­velop bet­ter acel­lu­lar vac­cines,” said Dr. Stan­ley Plotkin, an emer­i­tus pro­fes­sor of pe­di­atrics at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Penn­syl­va­nia. The new vac­cines are known as acel­lu­lar, as they con­tain pu­ri­fied pro­teins, in­stead of com­plete bac­te­ria that have been killed. “A great deal of thought and dis­cus­sion is be­ing de­vot­ed to that at the mo­ment,” he said.</p> <p>The cur­rent vac­cines, usu­ally ad­min­is­tered in in­fancy, pre­school and ad­o­les­cence, pro­tect well in ear­ly child­hood. But by ad­o­les­cence, the pro­tec­tive ef­fects wane quick­ly. Doc­tors of­ten rec­om­mend boost­ers. Death from whoop­ing cough can oc­cur in in­fants, but is un­usual in adults.</p> <p>The cur­rent whoop­ing cough vac­cines were de­vel­oped af­ter a surge in con­cerns from par­ents that their chil­dren were get­ting fevers and hav­ing seizures af­ter re­ceiv­ing the old vac­cine. Those wor­ries added fu­el to gen­er­al skep­ti­cism about vac­cines that had led some par­ents to choose not to have their chil­dren vac­ci­nat­ed.</p> <p>But sci­en­tists say the prob­lem of surg­ing whoop­ing cough cases has more to do with flaws in the cur­rent vac­cines than with par­ents’ re­sist­ance. The new find­ing sug­gests yet an­other weak­ness of the vac­cine — that even peo­ple re­cent­ly vac­ci­nat­ed may be con­tinu­ing to spread the in­fec­tion with­out get­ting sick.</p> <p>“The ba­boon model has pro­vided an il­lu­mi­nat­ing in­sight in­to the epi­dem­ic as we are cop­ing with it to­day,” said Dr. William Schaffn­er, a pro­fes­sor of pre­ven­tive medi­cine at Van­der­bilt Uni­ver­si­ty, who was not in­volved in the study.</p> </div>",

The choice to name Mr. McMil­lon — who will be the young­est chief ex­ec­u­tive to lead the com­pa­ny since its founder, Sam Wal­ton — el­e­vates an in­sider with deep roots in the com­pa­ny. He <a title=\"More information on Mr. McMillon.\" href=\"http://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/leadership/executive-management/doug-mcmillon/\">joined Wal­mart in 1984</a> as a sum­mer as­so­ci­ate in a dis­tri­b­u­tion cen­ter, then re­joined in 1990. From 2006 to 2009, he was pres­i­dent of Sam’s Club, Wal­mart’s ware­house stores di­vi­sion. </p> <p>Mr. McMil­lon’s new sal­ary and com­pen­sa­tion pack­age were not re­vealed on Mon­day. His sal­ary for the 2013 fis­cal year was near­ly $930,000, while his to­tal com­pen­sa­tion was slight­ly over $9.5 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the com­pa­ny. </p> <p>Mr. Duke’s sal­ary was about $1.3 mil­lion, and his to­tal com­pen­sa­tion was rough­ly $20 mil­lion. Af­ter re­tir­ing, he will stay on as an ad­viser for a year. </p> <p>“The op­por­tu­nity to lead Wal­mart is a great priv­i­lege,” Mr. McMil­lon said in the com­pa­ny’s state­ment. “Our com­pa­ny has a rich his­to­ry of de­liv­er­ing value to cus­tomers across the globe and, as their needs grow and change, we will be there to serve them.”</p> <p>At the share­hold­ers’ meet­ing in 2012, Mr. McMil­lon told a story of re­ceiv­ing a Post-it note about the price of tri­lene fish­ing line from Wal­mart’s founder, “Mr. Sam,” in 1991, on his first day on the com­pa­ny’s mer­chan­dis­ing team. Kmart’s price, the note said, was just a bit low­er than Wal­mart’s.</p> <p>“This is from Sam Wal­ton,” Mr. McMil­lon’s new boss said, he re­count­ed. “Have you fixed it?”</p> <p>At Wal­mart, a con­nec­tion to “Mr. Sam” is cur­ren­cy.</p> <p>Mr. McMil­lon’s main com­peti­tor for the job, in­dus­try ex­perts said, was prob­a­bly William S. Si­mon, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Wal­mart U.S. Mr. Si­mon joined Wal­mart in 2006 from Brinker In­ter­na­tion­al, a com­pa­ny that owns restau­rant fran­chises like Chili’s Grill and Bar.</p> <p>“It looks like they took an in­sider over an out­sider,” said Suchari­ta Mulpu­ru, an an­a­lyst at For­rester.</p> <p>“Bill Si­mon joined more re­cent­ly, he had more of a restau­rant back­ground,” Ms. Mulpu­ru said. “Doug McMil­lon is more of a com­pa­ny lif­er, so to speak. He’s been at the com­pa­ny a long, long time.”</p> <p>In re­cent years, Ms. Mulpu­ru said, the in­ter­na­tion­al arm of Wal­mart has been a greater en­gine of growth than ei­ther the do­mes­tic di­vi­sion or Sam’s Club, and since 2009 Mr. McMil­lon has been run­ning the in­ter­na­tion­al op­er­a­tion. In Oc­to­ber, the com­pa­ny an­nounced it would <a title=\"Times article.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/business/international/wal-marts-china-plan-to-focus-on-e-commerce.html\">open up to 110 new fa­cil­i­ties in Chi­na</a> by 2016.</p> <p>In re­cent years, Wal­mart’s in­ter­na­tion­al di­vi­sion has been touched by scan­dal, though Mr. McMil­lon has not been im­pli­cated. The Jus­tice De­part­ment has been in­ves­ti­gat­ing whether Wal­mart vi­o­lat­ed the For­eign Cor­rupt Prac­tices Act in Mex­i­co and oth­er coun­tries, since <a title=\"Times article.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/business/walmart-bribes-teotihuacan.html\">The New York Times re­port­ed</a> last year that of­fi­cials at Wal­mart de Mex­i­co paid bribes to grease the wheels of ex­pan­sion. </p> <p>Brooke Bu­chanan, a Wal­mart spokes­woman, said the ac­tiv­i­ties be­ing in­ves­ti­gat­ed pre­ced­ed Mr. McMil­lon’s lead­er­ship of Wal­mart In­ter­na­tion­al.</p> <p>In its most re­cent quar­ter­ly earn­ings re­lease, Wal­mart ac­knowl­edged that it faced head­winds go­ing in­to the hol­i­day sea­son. With its core cus­tomers still en­coun­ter­ing stag­nant wages and per­sist­ent un­em­ploy­ment, the com­pa­ny trimmed its year­ly earn­ings fore­cast.</p> <p>In ad­di­tion to those chal­lenges, Mr. McMil­lon will take Wal­mart’s helm as the re­tail­er faces chal­lenges from or­ga­nized la­bor. Unions and their al­lies are threat­en­ing to stage protests at 1,500 Wal­mart stores across the na­tion on Black Fri­day to de­mand that the com­pa­ny in­crease wages. </p> <p>And last week, the gen­er­al coun­sel of the Na­tion­al La­bor Re­la­tions Board <a title=\"Times article.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/business/labor-panel-finds-illegal-punishments-at-walmart.html\">ac­cused Wal­mart</a> of il­le­gal­ly fir­ing or oth­er­wise re­tali­at­ing against work­ers in 14 states for push­ing for high­er wages.</p> <p>In re­cent weeks, Wal­mart has been busi­ly pro­mot­ing its hol­i­day deals in one of the most fiercely com­pet­i­tive sales sea­sons in re­cent mem­ory. Ma­jor re­tail­ers are al­ready slash­ing prices and many have been chip­ping away at the lure of Black Fri­day deals by of­fer­ing them even ear­lier, driven part­ly by the short win­dow this year be­tween Thanks­giv­ing and Christ­mas. None­the­less, the next few days will prob­a­bly be among the busi­est of the hol­i­day sea­son.</p> <p>Da­vid To­var, Wal­mart’s vice pres­i­dent for cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions, said the tim­ing of the an­nounce­ment about Mr. McMil­lon, just four days be­fore Black Fri­day, was dic­tat­ed by the sched­ule of com­pa­ny board meet­ings — the No­vem­ber meet­ing is clos­est to the com­pa­ny’s new fis­cal year, which be­gins Feb. 1.</p> <p>“This was sole­ly his de­ci­sion, a per­sonal de­ci­sion Mike made to re­tire at this point,” Mr. To­var said of Mr. Duke.</p> <p>“Oth­er than play­ing a lot of golf, I don’t think he’s go­ing to be work­ing on any­thing at this point,” he said. </p> <p>When Mr. Duke leaves the com­pa­ny, he will be en­ti­tled to more than $113 mil­lion in de­ferred com­pen­sa­tion.</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>In his 2006 hit play, “Rock ’n’ Roll,” the British play­wright Tom Stop­pard ex­am­ined the re­la­tion­ship be­tween mu­sic and poli­tics, shut­tling back and forth be­tween Eng­land and Czecho­slo­va­kia over a 25-year pe­riod. Now, in a new work, a one-hour ra­dio play called “Dark­side,” he has nar­rowed his fo­cus to a sin­gle fa­mous al­bum, Pink Floyd’s “The Dark Side of the Moon.”</p> <p>Com­mis­sioned by the BBC to com­mem­o­rate the 40th an­ni­ver­sary of the re­lease of a re­cord­ing that has sold more than 50 mil­lion cop­ies world­wide, “Dark­side” was broad­cast in Au­gust and this week will be re­leased in CD form (Pink Floyd Mu­sic). Mr. Stop­pard has stripped the record of most of its lyrics, writ­ing his own text to be re­cited over the orig­i­nal mu­sic while in­ter­mit­tent­ly draw­ing on the band mem­ber Roger Wa­ters’s words to pro­vide com­men­tary on what has just hap­pened.</p> <p>The sub­ject mat­ter of “Dark­side” will be fa­mil­iar to any­one who has ever taken a col­lege course in ethics or moral phi­los­o­phy. The cast, which in­cludes Bill Nighy and Ru­fus Sew­ell, acts out fa­mil­iar thought ex­per­i­ments from that realm, like the Pris­oner’s Di­lemma and the Speed­ing Trol­ley, with plen­ty of joc­u­lar asides and sub­tle jokes in­sert­ed.</p> <p>In “Rock ’n’ Roll,” Mr. Stop­pard, now 76, showed a for­mi­da­ble fa­mil­iar­ity with the pop mu­sic of the ’60s and ’70s, re­fer­ring to the Rolling Stones, Ji­mi Hen­drix, the Beach Boys, the Grate­ful Dead, the Vel­vet Un­der­ground, the Doors and Queen. In a tele­phone in­ter­view last week­end from his home in Eng­land, he talked about the gen­e­sis of “Dark­side” and his cath­o­lic taste in pop mu­sic. Here are edit­ed ex­cerpts from that con­ver­sa­tion: </p> <p><strong>Q.</strong> What did you ini­tial­ly see as the chal­lenges to adapt­ing this record to play form? </p> <p><strong>A.</strong> I had ab­solute­ly no idea what to do with it, which I guess is nor­mal. </p> <p>I was very pleased about the whole thing. It’s very com­mon for peo­ple to rec­om­mend some­thing to me be­cause they’re go­ing on what I’ve al­ready writ­ten, when, what re­al­ly is the case, is that you want to write about some­thing you ha­ven’t writ­ten about, in ways that you ha­ven’t done be­fore.</p> <p><strong>Q.</strong> Did it seem to you that hav­ing to work from the record, and in a fixed time slot, was con­strain­ing? </p> <p><strong>A.</strong> For my whole ca­reer, from the very be­gin­ning, I think, I’ve liked be­ing given pa­ra­me­ters or fron­tiers or di­rec­tions. You know, “Rosen­crantz and Guilden­stern are Dead” is an ex­am­ple. I had to work in­side Shake­speare’s play. Work­ing in­side Pink Floyd’s al­bum is the same syn­drome re­al­ly.</p> <p><strong>Q.</strong> In the end, “Dark­side” strikes me as a kind of com­edy about moral phi­los­o­phy. Would you agree?</p> <p><strong>A.</strong> I think that’s fair enough. I was us­ing things from my own read­ing, things I’ve been col­lect­ing for the pur­poses of a play for years and years. This is al­ready some­thing I want­ed to write about, and the al­bum felt to me like a bunch of songs that were say­ing, “Yeah, come on, use up some of that stuff, and don’t keep sav­ing it for some three-hour play.” </p> <p><strong>Q.</strong> Did you feel any trepi­da­tion about largely eras­ing Roger Wa­ters’s lyrics? </p> <p><strong>A.</strong> In point of fact, I had less trepi­da­tion about that than I did in writ­ing over the mu­sic. I know Da­vid Gilmour some­what bet­ter than I know the oth­er mem­bers of the band, and I was feel­ing dif­fi­dent about the pos­si­bil­i­ty that Da­vid would mind if the mu­sic was pushed in­to the back­ground, half-heard, in or­der for my words to take the fore­ground. So I called him up, and he was com­plete­ly O.K. about that. He said, “Go ahead, fine.” Let’s face it, “Dark Side of the Moon” is not vul­ner­a­ble to be­ing ob­scured by a ra­dio play. [Laughs.]</p> <p><strong>Q.</strong> We know from your play “Rock ’n’ Roll,” with its ref­er­ences to Pink Floyd, that you have an af­fin­ity for the band. Why it rather than an­other of the many groups you men­tion in that play? </p> <p><strong>A.</strong> I just think they’re a re­al­ly ex­cep­tion­al bunch of peo­ple. I think “The Wall” is a mas­ter­piece, and when I made a film of my “Rosen­crantz and Guilden­stern,” I ac­tu­al­ly used a track from “Med­dle” called “Fear­less.” What I’m try­ing to say is the BBC were seven-eighths of the way there, with­out know­ing it, when they con­tact­ed me. I guess be­cause of the play “Rock ’n’ Roll,” they prob­a­bly thought I was a good per­son to ap­proach, and they were right. </p> <p><strong>Q.</strong> Can you talk about your own his­to­ry with “The Dark Side of the Moon”?</p> <p><strong>A.</strong> This par­tic­u­lar al­bum was ac­tu­al­ly given to me as a present when it was brand-new in 1973 by a friend who walked in with it and said, “Tom, lis­ten to this al­bum, you have to write a play about it.” I was writ­ing “Trav­es­ties” at the time, and I didn’t want to be dis­tract­ed in­to think­ing about some band’s al­bum. I had bare­ly heard of the band; I wasn’t a Syd Bar­rett [of Pink Floyd] fol­low­er; ear­ly Floyd I was aware of, I’m sure, but I didn’t lis­ten to “Dark Side of the Moon” for ages. So, when this BBC let­ter showed up, it was quite ex­traor­di­nary. It was like a cir­cle clos­ing.</p> <p><strong>Q.</strong> You em­braced rock in the ’60s, at a time when few peo­ple your age and even few­er in­tel­lec­tu­als did. What ac­counts for that ear­ly in­ter­est? </p> <p><strong>A.</strong> I can on­ly an­swer by say­ing that I can’t re­mem­ber ever not lis­ten­ing to pop mu­sic from the time I was 12 or so. I just liked it. When I was 20, in 1957, and maybe you would say I was old enough to know bet­ter, but nev­er­the­less I was com­plete­ly nuts about Bud­dy Hol­ly. And I loved pop bands that had ab­solute­ly no in­tel­lec­tual pre­ten­sions what­so­ever. I loved the Mon­kees. [Laughs.]</p> <p>When I was a re­porter in Bris­tol, which I was be­tween the years 1954 and 1960, the news­pa­per would get tick­ets for who­ever showed up to play a gig at the big hall down the road, so I saw some won­der­ful peo­ple. The Ever­ly Broth­ers, for ex­am­ple. Who didn’t love the Ever­ly Broth­ers? I didn’t lis­ten to mu­sic with any un­der­stand­ing at all, I bet­ter make that clear — it was a pure­ly un­me­di­ated re­sponse to a par­tic­u­lar kind of noise, and it just worked com­plete­ly for me.</p> <p><strong>Q.</strong> I want­ed to ask you about oth­er pop cul­ture ref­er­ences in “Dark­side,” es­pe­cial­ly the quo­ta­tions from movie di­a­logue. One of the films cited is “The Wiz­ard of Oz,” which, of course, plays in­to the ur­ban leg­end that “The Dark Side of the Moon” was made as a kind of se­cret, hid­den sound­track to that movie.</p> <p><strong> A.</strong> Yeah, I like pri­vate jokes ac­tu­al­ly in what I do, and I don’t mind if I’m the on­ly per­son who knows they are there. </p> <p><strong>Q.</strong> So you were kind of wink­ing at us there. </p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Wink­ing at you is right. [Laughs.] </p> </div>",
